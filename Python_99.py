def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should

def binary_gap(num):
    '''
    A binary gap between two integers A and B is any maximal sequence of consecutive
    zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of A.

    If there is no such sequence, return 0.

    Examples

        1041 should return 5
        100 should return 0
        2147483644 should return 2


    Return an integer corresponding to the size of the largest binary
    gap among the first n integers in the range of [A...B]
    '''
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.
