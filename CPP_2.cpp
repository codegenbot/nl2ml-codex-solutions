Here's the modified code with the issues fixed:
```
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>

float truncate_number(float number) {
    return number - (int)number;
}

int main() {
    assert (std::abs(truncate_number(123.456) - 0.456) < 1e-4);
    return 0;
}
```
Note:

* The `assert` macro is defined in the `<cassert>` header file, which is included at the top of the code.
* The function `main()` is only defined once in the code.
* The `abs()` function is replaced with `std::abs()`, which is the standard library function for computing the absolute value of a number.
