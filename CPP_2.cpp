Sure, here's the modified code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
#include <cmath>

float truncate_number(float number) {
    return number - (int)number;
}

int main() {
    assert(std::abs(truncate_number(123.456) - 0.456) < 1e-4);
    return 0;
}
```
The error message was indicating that there were multiple definitions of the `main` function, which is not allowed in C++. The solution was to remove one of the definitions or rename one of them so that they have different names.
