def double_the_difference(lst):
    result = 0
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 != 0 and num > 0:
            result += num ** 2
    return result
```
Modify the code as  You need to define the variable `lst` before passing it into the `double_the_difference()` function. You can do this by reading input from the user using the `input()` function, like this:
```
lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
```
This will prompt the user to enter a space-separated list of integers, which will be converted into a Python list using the `list()` and `map()` functions. The resulting list is then passed as an argument to the `double_the_difference()` function..
