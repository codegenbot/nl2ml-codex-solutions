def double_the_difference(lst):

    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 1 and num > 0:

# Define the list 'lst'
lst = [1, 3, 5, 7]
```
Alternatively, you can also pass a list of integers as an argument when calling the function. For example:
```
print(double_the_difference([1, 3, 5, 7]))
```
Modify the code as  The issue is that the function signature has an extra closing parenthesis after `lst`. To fix this, simply remove the extra parenthesis so that the function signature matches the expected format:
```
def double_the_difference(lst):
    result = 0
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 1 and num > 0:
            result += num ** 2
    return result
```
