def double_the_difference(lst):
    result = 0
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 1 and num > 0:
            result += num**2
    return result
```
Solution: The problem is that the function call `double_the_difference(lst)` is incorrect because `lst` does not exist. To fix the code, we need to define `lst` before passing it to the function. We can do this by using a list comprehension:

```python
lst = [num for num in range(1, 6) if num % 2 == 1 and num > 0]
double_the_difference(lst)
```
This will create a new list `lst` containing only the odd numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive), and pass it as an argument to the function.
