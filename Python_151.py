```
def double_the_difference(list):
    result = 0
    for num in list:
        if num % 2 != 0 and num > 0:
            result += num ** 2
    return result
```
The issue with the current code is that the function signature specifies `list` as an input, but the function body uses `lst` instead of `list`. To fix this, simply change all instances of `lst` to `list` in the function body.
