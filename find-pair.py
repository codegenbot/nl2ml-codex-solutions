The issue with the current implementation is that it only returns two of the three elements that sum up to the target value. To fix this, you can modify the return statement to include all three elements in the output.
```
return nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]
```
This will ensure that all three elements are included in the output, even if they are not adjacent in the input array.
