The issue with the current implementation is that it is only returning two elements that sum up to the target value, but the problem description requires all three elements to be returned. To fix this issue, we can modify the return statement to include all three elements that sum up to the target value. Here's the modified code:
```
def find_pair(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]
    return None, None, None
```
This code will now return all three elements that sum up to the target value, even if they are not adjacent in the input array.
