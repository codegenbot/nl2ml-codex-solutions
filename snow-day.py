Here is the completed code:

def snow_day(hours, initial_snow, rate_of_snowfall, proportion_melting_per_hour):
    return initial_snow + (rate_of_snowfall - proportion_melting_per_hour) * hours

# Read input from user
hours = int(input("Enter the number of hours: "))
initial_snow = float(input("Enter the amount of snow on the ground initially: "))
rate_of_snowfall = float(input("Enter the rate of snow fall per hour: "))
proportion_melting_per_hour = float(input("Enter the proportion of snow melting per hour: "))

# Calculate the amount of snow on the ground after the given number of hours
snow_on_ground = snow_day(hours, initial_snow, rate_of_snowfall, proportion_melting_per_hour)

print(f"The amount of snow on the ground is {snow_on_ground:.6f}.")
