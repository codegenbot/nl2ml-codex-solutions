Here is the Python function that solves the problem:

def snow_day(hours, current_snow, rate_of_snowfall, proportion_melting):
    total_snow = 0
    for _ in range(hours):
        new_snow = rate_of_snowfall
        total_snow += new_snow
        total_snow -= min(total_snow, total_snow * proportion_melting)
    return round(total_snow, 6)
