```cpp
Problem: CPP/128

The issue is that you have an unnecessary `Here is the completed code:` block and stray backticks (`) at the top of your file. Remove the first few lines to fix the errors:

int prod_signs(vector<int> arr){
    int sign_product = 1;
    long long sum_of_magnitudes = 0;

    for(int num : arr){
        if(num == 0) continue;
        sign_product *= (num > 0 ? 1 : -1);
        sum_of_magnitudes += abs(num);
    }

    return (arr.empty()) ? -32768 : sign_product * sum_of_magnitudes;
}
