The issue is that there are no quotes around the description at the top of your file, causing a SyntaxError. Remove or comment out this extra text to solve the problem.

Here's how:

1. If you don't want this description anymore, remove it.

2. Or if you want to keep the description as a comment, add `#` before it like this: `# 

So, here is the corrected code:

```
def search(lst):
    frequency_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[num] = 1
    max_value = -1
    for num, freq in frequency_dict.items():
        if num > 0 and freq >= num:
            max_value = num
            break
    return max_value
