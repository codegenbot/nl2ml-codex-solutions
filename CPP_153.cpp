The error message is indicating that there are unmatched backticks (```) in your code. Specifically, it mentions that there are stray backticks at lines 1 and 26.
To fix this issue, you should remove the extra backticks from your code. The backtick character (`) is used to indicate a string literal in C++, but if you don't use it correctly, it can cause syntax errors.

Here's an example of how you could modify your code to fix the error:
```
string Strongest_Extension(string class_name, vector<string> extensions) {
    int max_strength = 0;
    string strongest_extension;
    for (int i = 0; i < extensions.size(); i++) {
        int strength = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < extensions[i].length(); j++) {
            if (isupper(extensions[i][j])) {
                strength++;
            } else if (islower(extensions[i][j])) {
                strength--;
            }
        }
        if (strength > max_strength) {
            max_strength = strength;
            strongest_extension = extensions[i];
        }
    }
    return class_name + "." + strongest_extension;
}
```
Note that I removed the backticks from the code snippet you provided.
