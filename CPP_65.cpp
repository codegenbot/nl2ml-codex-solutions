```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int circular_shift(int x, int shift) {
    // your implementation here
}

int main() {
    int x = 1234567890;
    int shift = 10;
    cout << "The circularly shifted number is: " << circular_shift(x, shift) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Note: The issue with the code was caused by using backticks (``) to enclose the Python code. In C++, backticks are used for other purposes, and this causes an error. To fix the code, you can remove the backticks and replace them with a different delimiter, such as double quotes ("") or single quotes ('').
