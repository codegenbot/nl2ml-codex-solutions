Note: The issue with the code was caused by using backticks (``) to enclose the Python code. In C++, backticks are used for other purposes, and this causes an error. To fix the code, you can remove the backticks and replace them with a different delimiter, such as double quotes ("") or single quotes ('').

Modify the code as  The issue is caused by using backticks (``) to enclose the Python code in C++, which is not allowed. To fix the code, you can remove the backticks and replace them with a different delimiter, such as double quotes ("") or single quotes (''). Additionally, there are some other errors in the code, such as redefinition of `main()` and comparison between pointer and integer. To fix these errors, you should declare `__assert_fail` and ensure that the function signature for `circular_shift` matches the one provided in the task description..
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
