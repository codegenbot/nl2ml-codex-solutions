```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<float> sort_even(vector<float> l) {
    vector<float> even_sorted;
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            even_sorted.push_back(l[i]);
        }
    }
    sort(even_sorted.begin(), even_sorted.end());
    return even_sorted;
}
```
The code above is a function that takes in a vector of floats and returns the sorted version of only the even indices of the input vector. The function first iterates through the input vector and adds all elements at even indices to a new vector called "even_sorted". It then sorts the "even_sorted" vector using the std::sort algorithm and returns it as the output.

The code is correct but could be improved in terms of readability and performance. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use more descriptive variable names: Instead of using "l" for the input vector, use a name that describes its purpose, such as "input". Similarly, instead of using "even_sorted" for the sorted output, use a name that describes its purpose, such as "sorted_even_indices".
2. Use const references where possible: Instead of passing the input vector by value and making a copy of it, pass it by const reference to avoid unnecessary copying. This can improve performance for large vectors.
3. Use modern C++ algorithms: The std::sort algorithm is a good choice for sorting, but there are other algorithms that may be more appropriate depending on the size of the input vector. For example, if the input vector is very small (e.g., less than 10 elements), using std::stable_sort or std::partial_sort might be faster.
4. Use meaningful return types: The function returns a sorted vector of floats, but it would be more clear to return a vector of indices that correspond to the sorted elements in the input vector. This way, the caller can easily retrieve the original values from the input vector if needed.
