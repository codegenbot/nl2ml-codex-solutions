The issue you're encountering is a syntax error caused by the backticks (```) in your code snippet. To fix this, remove the extra ` characters and replace them with single quotes (') or double quotes ("):
```c++
assert(largestPrime({127, 97, 8192}) == 10);
```.
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
