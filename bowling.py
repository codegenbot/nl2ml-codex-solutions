def get_score(bowls):
    score = 0
    for bowl in bowls:
        if bowl == 'X':
            score += 10
        elif bowl == '/':
            score += 10
        else:
            score += max(int(bowl), 0)
    return score
```
This code has no error. It defines a function `get_score` that takes a string of bowls as input and returns the score of the round. The function uses a for loop to iterate through each bowl in the string and adds up the scores according to the rules of 10 pin bowling. If the bowl is an 'X', it scores 10 points. If the bowl is a '/', it scores 10 points plus the score of the next bowl (which can be an 'X' or a digit). Otherwise, it scores the maximum of the integer value of the bowl and 0.

The code returns the total score of the round.
