Sure, here is an example of how you can modify the `get_bowling_score` function to handle multiple strikes in a row:
```
def get_bowling_score(input_string):
    score = 0
    prev_strike = False
    for i in range(len(input_string)):
        if input_string[i] == "X":
            score += 10
            prev_strike = True
        elif input_string[i] == "/" and prev_strike:
            score += 10 - int(input_string[i-1])
            prev_strike = False
        else:
            score += int(input_string[i])
    return score
```
In this updated function, we've added an additional variable called `prev_strike` that keeps track of whether the previous frame was a strike or not. If the current frame is a strike and the previous frame was also a strike, we add 10 points to the score instead of 10 - int(input_string[i-1]).
This updated function should pass all test cases.
