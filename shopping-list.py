# Plan:
1. Read the number of items from the user.
2. Read the prices of the items from the user and store them in a list.
3. Read the discounts for each item from the user and store them in a list.
4. Iterate over the prices and discounts lists simultaneously and calculate the total price after discount for each item.
5. Sum up all the discounted prices and return the result.
