>> The error message indicates that the function `setprecision` is not declared in the scope of the `main()` function. This is because the function `setprecision` is defined in the `iostream` header file, but it is not included in the code snippet provided.

To fix this issue, you can include the `iostream` header file at the beginning of the code snippet, like this:
```
#include <iostream>
```
This will allow the function `setprecision` to be used in the code snippet.
