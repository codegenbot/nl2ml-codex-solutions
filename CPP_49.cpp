The problem is to modify the given code to make it work correctly for all inputs. The current code has a bug in the `modp` function, which causes it to return incorrect results for certain input values.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition in the `if` statement to check if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, we should return `3 * n + 1`, and if `n` is even, we should return `n / 2`.

Here's the corrected code:
```
#include <iostream>

int modp(int n) {
    if (n % 2 == 1) { // Check if n is odd
        return 3 * n + 1;
    } else { // If n is even
        return n / 2;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 0;
    while (n < 10) {
        std::cout << modp(n) << '\n';
        n++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
