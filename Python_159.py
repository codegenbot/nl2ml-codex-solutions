```
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    total_eaten = number + need
    carrots_left = remaining - need
    if carrots_left < 0:
        carrots_left = 0
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
```
The issue with the original code is that it only uses two of the three arguments passed to the function. To fix this, we need to modify the code to use all three arguments. I have updated the code to include the `remaining` argument in the calculation of `carrots_left`.
