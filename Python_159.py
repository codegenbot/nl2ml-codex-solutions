The error message indicates that the `eat` function is defined to take two arguments, but three are being passed when it's called with `eat(4, 5, 1)`. To fix this issue, you should either pass only two arguments or modify the function signature to accept three arguments.

Here's a modified version of the code that accepts three arguments:
```
def eat(number, need, extra):
    total_eaten = number + need + extra
    carrots_left = max(0, remaining - (need + extra))
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
```
