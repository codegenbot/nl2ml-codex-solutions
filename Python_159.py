```
def eat(number, need):
    total_eaten = number + need
    carrots_left = max(0, remaining - need)
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
```

The function `eat` takes two arguments, but three are passed when it is called on line 9: `eat(4, 5, 1)`. To fix this, either remove the extra argument from the call or add another parameter to the function signature.
