The issue with the current implementation of `eat` is that it returns a list containing two elements: `total_eaten` and `carrots_left`. However, the assert statement only checks for one value returned by the function. To fix this, you can change the assert statement to check for both values:
```
assert eat(4, 5, 1) == [5, 0], "Error"
```
This way, the assert statement will check that `eat` returns a list with two elements, and that the first element is equal to `5`, and the second element is equal to `0`.
