```
def eat(number: int, remaining: int) -> (int, int):
    total_eaten = number + remaining
    carrots_left = max(0, remaining - number)
    return total_eaten, carrots_left
```
I made the following changes to your code:

* I added type hints for the `number` and `remaining` parameters. This is a good practice in Python to make it clear what types of data the function expects.
* I changed the return value from a list of two elements to a tuple of two integers, which is more idiomatic in Python.
* I removed the extra ```` at the beginning of your code snippet.
