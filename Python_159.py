The issue is that the `eat` function takes two parameters, but three are being passed when it's called with `eat(4, 5, 1)`. To fix this, you can add a third parameter to the `eat` function or remove one of the arguments from the function call. Here is an example of how you could modify the code:
```
def eat(number, remaining, need):
    total_eaten = number + need
    carrots_left = max(0, remaining - need)
    return [total_eaten], [carrots_left]
```
or 
```
def eat(number, remaining):
    total_eaten = number + need
    carrots_left = max(0, remaining - need)
    return [total_eaten], [carrots_left]
```
