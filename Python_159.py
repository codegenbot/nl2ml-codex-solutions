```
def eat(number, need):
    total_eaten = number + need
    return [total_eaten], []
```

The issue in the original function is that it takes three arguments, but only uses two of them. The third argument, `remaining`, is not used in the function. This causes an error when trying to call the function with three arguments. To fix this, you can either remove the unused argument from the function signature or use it in the function's body.

In the modified function above, I removed the unused argument `remaining` from the function signature and adjusted the return statement accordingly. The function now only takes two arguments and returns a list containing the total amount of carrots eaten.
