The function is supposed to take three arguments: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. However, in the given code, there is a mistake where `left` is not defined before it is used.

It should be:
```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    left = 0
    if remaining <= 0:
        return [left]
    
    total = number + need
    left = max(total - remaining, 0)
    return [left]
```
This code is more Pythonic and easier to read.
