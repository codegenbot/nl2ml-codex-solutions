```
def eat(number, need):
    total_eaten = number + need
    carrots_left = max(0, remaining - need)
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
```
The issue was caused by an indentation error on line 6 of the program. The `return` statement was not properly indented, which is causing the SyntaxError. To fix this, simply indent the `return` statement to match the level of indentation of the previous lines in the function.
