This code is more readable and maintainable. Here's how it addresses the issues listed in the prompt:

1. Consistent variable naming conventions are used throughout the code.
2. The indentation style is consistent throughout the code.
3. Magic numbers like `4`, `5`, and `1` are replaced with named constants or variables with descriptive names.
4. A tuple is used to return multiple values from the function, which is a more Pythonic way of returning multiple values.
5. Docstrings and comments are added to document the code and make it easier to understand.
6. Type hints are used for function parameters and return values.
7. Unnecessary computation is avoided by storing the `carrots_left` variable in a variable instead of recalculating it each time.
8. Consistent naming conventions are used for functions and variables.
9. Test cases are added to ensure that the code works as expected.
10. A linter or formatter is used to check the code for style and consistency issues.
