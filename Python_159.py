```
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    total_eaten = number + need
    carrots_left = remaining - need
    if carrots_left < 0:
        carrots_left = 0
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
```
The issue with the original code is that it only uses two of the three arguments passed to the function. To fix this, we need to modify the code inside the function to use all three arguments. In this case, we can simply add the `number` argument to the calculation of `total_eaten`.

The modified code should look like this:
```
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    total_eaten = number + need
    carrots_left = remaining - need
    if carrots_left < 0:
        carrots_left = 0
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
```
