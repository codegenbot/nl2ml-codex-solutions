#This program calculates the amount of food left after eating a certain amount
#given by "number" and the remaining amount of food given by "remaining". The function signature is as follows:
def eat(number, need, remaining):
#check if there's enough food to eat. If remaining is greater than 0, we have enough food.
if remaining <= 0 or need >= remaining:
return [total, left]
#calculate the total amount of food eaten.
total = number + need
#calculate the amount of food left after eating.
left = max(total - remaining, 0)
#return the total amount of food eaten and the amount of food left.
return [total, left]
