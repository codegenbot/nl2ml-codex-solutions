    collisions = {}
    while left_to_right < n and right_to_left >= 0:
        if left_to_right == right_to_left:
            collisions[(left_to_right, right_to_left)] = 1
            left_to_right += 1
            right_to_left -= 1
        elif left_to_right < right_to_left:
            left_to_right += 1

    return sum(collisions.values())
```
The issue with the original code is that it only considers collisions between cars moving in opposite directions, but it does not take into account the possibility of multiple collisions between the same two cars. To fix this, we need to keep track of all the collisions that have occurred and make sure that each collision is only counted once.
One way to do this is to use a dictionary to keep track of the collisions, where the keys are tuples representing the positions of the two cars involved in the collision, and the values are the number of times those cars have collided. We can then iterate through the dictionary at the end and sum up all the values to get the total number of collisions.
Here's the modified code:
```
def car_race_collision(n):
    left_to_right = 0
    right_to_left = n - 1
    collisions = {}
    while left_to_right < n and right_to_left >= 0:
        if left_to_right == right_to_left:
            if (left_to_right, right_to_left) not in collisions:
                collisions[(left_to_right, right_to_left)] = 1
            else:
                collisions[(left_to_right, right_to_left)] += 1
            left_to_right += 1
            right_to_left -= 1
        elif left_to_right < right_to_left:
            left_to_right += 1
        else:
            right_to_left -= 1
    return sum(collisions.values())
```
This code should now correctly count the number of collisions in a car race with `n` cars, taking into account the possibility of multiple collisions between the same two cars.
