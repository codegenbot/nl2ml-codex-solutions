def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    # TODO:  Complete the following code.

    # 1) Use the following function signature.


    # 2) In your implementation, you are allowed to use
    # the following functions:
    #   - car_race_collision;
    #   - min;
    #   - max;
    #   - any other functions from the standard Python library;

    # 3) You are NOT allowed to use any other functions.
    # Your goal is to complete the following code so that
    # it outputs the correct result.

    # 4) Your code must run in O(n) time.

    # 5) You are NOT allowed to use any mutable data structures such as list, set, dictionary, etc.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
