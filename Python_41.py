    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    You've been hired to write a program for a newspaper that converts long-ish text into a format that fits on a single line.
    There are three rules that you must follow when performing the conversion:
    1> If a line is already short enough (less than 55 characters), don't do anything to that line
    2> If a line contains no periods, output the original line
    3> Otherwise, keep the first 40 characters on the first line, then add a period, and finally add the last line,
       so that the total number of characters is <= 55.

    Please complete the function below so that it behaves as described
