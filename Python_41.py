    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    # given n, which is the number of cars, we create an array of cars
    # each car has a position and a direction.
    # the left to right cars have positive direction,
    # and the right to left cars have negative direction.

    # To count the number of collisions, we can iterate through the list of cars,
    # and count the number of cars that have the same position and opposite directions.
    # This is a O(n^2) algorithm.
    # Let's see if we can do better.

    # Suppose we sort the positions of the cars.  Then we can iterate through the list
    # of cars, and we can count the number of cars that have opposite directions.
    # As we iterate, we can keep track of the current position.  If the current position
    # changes, then we can reset the count of the number of cars with opposite directions.
    # This is an O(n log n) algorithm.

    # To go faster, we can try a divide and conquer approach.
    # We can recursively partition the list of cars into two sublists.
    # Then we can count the number of collisions in the left sublist,
    # and we can count the number of collisions in the right sublist.
    # Finally, we can count the number of collisions that involve cars from the left sublist
    # and cars from the right sublist.
    # The left sublist contains all cars whose position is less than the median position.
    # The right sublist contains all cars whose position is greater than or equal to the median position.
    # To count the number of collisions involving cars from the left sublist and cars from the right sublist,
    # we can first sort the left and right sublists by direction.
    # Then we can iterate through the cars in the left sublist, and we can count the number of cars
    # in the right sublist that have opposite direction.  This is an O(n log n) algorithm.
    # The divide and conquer algorithm is O(n log n)

    # Actually, it is possible to implement a sorting algorithm that is O(n) in the number of cars.
    # The idea is to use a special sorting method.
    # Let's say there are a total of n cars, and they are sorted into n buckets.
    # Then we can sort the cars in each bucket.  The cars that move left to right
    # are sorted in increasing order of position.  The cars that move right to left
    # are sorted in decreasing order of position.  By sorting the cars in each bucket,
    # we have partitioned the cars into n sublists.  Each sublist contains the cars that are in one bucket.
    # Then we can iterate through the n sublists, and we can count the number of cars that are
    # in the next sublist and have opposite direction.  This is an O(n) algorithm.
    # We can implement this algorithm by creating an array of n buckets.
    # Then we can iterate through the list of cars, and we can place each car into one bucket.
    # Then we can sort the cars in each bucket.  Finally, we can iterate through the buckets,
    # and we can count the number of cars in each bucket that have opposite direction from
    # the cars in the next bucket.  This algorithm is O(n) in the number of cars.

    # Let's see how we can implement the O(n log n) divide and conquer algorithm.

    # We first fill an array with values that represent the cars.
    # Each value is a positive number if the car moves left to right,
    # and the value is a negative number if the car moves right to left.
    # If the car is at position i, then the value is i if the car moves left to right,
    # and the value is -i if the car moves right to left.
    # We then sort the array.
    # Then we iterate through the sorted array and count the number of cars
    # that have opposite directions.  This is an O(n log n) algorithm.

    # We can also implement the O(n) algorithm.
    # This algorithm is more complex than the O(n log n) algorithm,
    # but it is more interesting.

    # First we create an array of buckets.
    # We then iterate through the array of cars, and we place each car into a bucket.
    # Then we sort the cars in each bucket.
    # Then we iterate through the buckets, and we count the number of cars in each bucket
    # that have opposite directions from the cars in the next bucket.

    # We can write a helper function that counts the number of collisions
    # that involve cars from the left sublist and cars from the right sublist.
    # This function takes as input the left and right sublists.
    # The left sublist contains all cars whose position is less than the median position.
    # The right sublist contains all cars whose position is greater than or equal to the median position.
    # The function returns the number of collisions.

    # We can write a recursive helper function that counts the number of collisions.
    # The function takes as input the list of cars.
    # The base case is when the list has length 0 or 1.
    # The recursive case is when the list has length greater than 1.
    # We first sort the list.
    # Then we count the number of collisions involving cars from the left sublist
    # and cars from the right sublist.
    # Then we count the number of collisions in the left sublist.
    # Then we count the number of collisions in the right sublist.
    # Finally, we add up the number of collisions.

    # The following code implements the O(n log n) divide and conquer algorithm.

        car_list[i] = i + 1
