    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    # Use a map where the key is the time, and the value is the number of cars that are
    # at the same place at that particular time.
    #
    # The first for loop loops through all the cars that go from left to right;
    # the second for loop loops through all the cars that go from right to left.
    # The collision happens when the cars are at the same place at the same time.
    #
    # The time it takes to go from right to left is different from the time it takes to go
    # from left to right.  Think about why this is true and how to calculate the collision time
    # accurately.

    collisions = 0

    return collisions

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
