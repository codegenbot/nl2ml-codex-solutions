    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    # TODO: complete the following code to solve the problem

    # Hint:
    #   1. You may want to use the following data structure:
    #       - a list of tuples, each tuple represents a car
    #       - the first element of the tuple is the car's position
    #       - the second element of the tuple is the car's direction
    #           - 1 means the car is moving left to right
    #           - -1 means the car is moving right to left
    #   2. You may want to use the following functions:
    #       - sorted()
    #       - enumerate()
    #       - zip()
    #   3. You may want to use the following variables:
    #       - collisions
    #       - cars

    collisions = 0
    cars = []

    return collisions

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
