```
def car_race_collision(n):
    left_to_right = 0
    right_to_left = n - 1
    collisions = {}
    while left_to_right < n and right_to_left >= 0:
        if left_to_right == right_to_left:
            collisions[(left_to_right, right_to_left)] = left_to_right + right_to_left - 1
            left_to_right += 1
            right_to_left -= 1
        elif left_to_right < right_to_left:
            left_to_right += 1
        else:
            right_to_left -= 1
    return sum(collisions.values())
```
This code modifies the original implementation by changing the line `collisions[(left_to_right, right_to_left)] = 1` to `collisions[(left_to_right, right_to_left)] = left_to_right + right_to_left - 1`. This ensures that the number of collisions is calculated correctly for each pair of cars.

Alternatively, you can modify the while loop condition to `while left_to_right < n and right_to_left >= 0 and left_to_right + right_to_left <= n`. This ensures that the number of collisions is calculated correctly for each pair of cars, taking into account the fact that there are at most n-1 collisions.

A third approach is to use a different algorithm to calculate the number of collisions in a car race with the given number of cars (n). For example, you can use a divide and conquer approach by recursively dividing the cars into two halves and counting the number of collisions in each half, then combining the results. This approach may be more efficient than the current implementation for large values of n.
