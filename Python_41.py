def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
    # Complete the following code.
    # You can add more helper functions if you want.
    # You can also change the function signature if you want.
    # You can also add more classes if you want.
    # You can also use more imports if you want.
    # Tip: Think about edge cases.
    # Tip: Think about how you can break the problem into subproblems.

    # Your code starts here.
    pass
    # Your code ends here.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
