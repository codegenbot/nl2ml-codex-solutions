Here is the solution:

def mastermind(code, guess):
    code_count = [0] * 6
    for c in code: 
        code_count[ord(c) - ord('A')] += 1

    white_pegs = sum(min(count, guess.count(c)) for count, c in zip(code_count, 'ABCDEF'))
    black_pegs = sum(1 for i, c in enumerate(guess) if c == code[i])

    return str(white_pegs) + '\n' + str(black_pegs)
