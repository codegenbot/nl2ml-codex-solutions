```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cassert>

int main() {
    std::string words[] = {"play", "play", "play"};
    assert((find_max(words, 3) == "play"));
    return 0;
}
```
Modify the code as  
The issue is with the `find_max` function, which is not declared or defined in the given code snippet. To fix this, you can either define the function before using it or include the appropriate header file that declares the function..
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
