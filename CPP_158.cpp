```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

std::string find_max(const std::vector<std::string>& words) {
    // Implementation of find_max function
}

int main() {
    assert ((find_max({"play", "play", "play"}) == "play"));
    return 0;
}
```

The issue is with the initialization of the vector `words` using an initializer list. The error message indicates that there is no matching function for the call to `operator new` with two arguments, which is used by the compiler to initialize the elements of the vector from the initializer list. To fix this, you can change the declaration of `words` to use a brace-enclosed initializer list instead of an initializer list:
```cpp
std::vector<std::string> words{"play", "play", "play"};
```
This will initialize the vector with three elements, each of which is a string containing the word "play". The compiler will then use the appropriate `operator new` function to allocate memory for the elements of the vector.
