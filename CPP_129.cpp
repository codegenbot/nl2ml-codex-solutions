Here is the modified code that should compile and run correctly:
```
vector<int> costs = {{1, 3}, {3, 2}};
assert(issame(minPath(costs, 10), {1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3}));
```
The issue was with the function signature of `issame`. The function takes two parameters, but the parameter types were not specified. To fix this, I added the type specifiers for the parameters, like this:
```
bool issame(vector<int> a, vector<int> b) { ... }
```
This should resolve the compilation errors related to `issame`.
