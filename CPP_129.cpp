```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool issame(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    return a == b;
}

vector<int> minPath(const vector<int>& costs, int target) {
    // Implement the function to find the minimum path
}

int main() {
    assert(issame(minPath({{1, 3}, {3, 2}}, 10), {{1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3}}));
}
```

Explanation:

The code has two definitions of `main()` function, which is not allowed in C++. The second definition of `main()` should be removed.

The assert statement is using a brace-enclosed initializer list as an argument, which cannot be used to initialize a reference variable. To fix this, the assert statement should pass two arguments of the same type.

Finally, the function `minPath()` should be defined before it is called in main().
