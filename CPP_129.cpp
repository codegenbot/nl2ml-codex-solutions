```
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool issame(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    if (a.size() != b.size()) return false;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
        if (a[i] != b[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

vector<int> minPath(const vector<vector<int>>& costs, int target) {
    // Implement this function to find the minimum path from the starting point to the target point.
    // The function should return a vector of integers representing the path.
    // For example, if the input is {{1, 3}, {3, 2}}, the output should be {1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3}.
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> costs = {{1, 3}, {3, 2}};
    assert(issame(minPath(costs, 10), {1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3}));
}
```

The issue is caused by the fact that there are two functions with the same name and signature in the code: `issame` and `minPath`. The compiler is unable to determine which function to call when it encounters the line `assert(issame(minPath({{1, 3}, {3, 2}}, 10) , {1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3}));`.

To fix this issue, you can either:

1. Rename one of the functions to avoid the name conflict. For example, you could rename `issame` to `is_same` or `minPath` to `find_min_path`.
2. Use fully qualified names for the functions to disambiguate them. For example, you could use `std::issame` and `std::minPath` instead of just `issame` and `minPath`.
3. Remove one of the functions from the code if it is not needed.

You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
