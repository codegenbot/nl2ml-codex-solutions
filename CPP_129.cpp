```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool issame(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    return a == b;
}

vector<int> minPath(const vector<int>& costs, int target) {
    // Implement the function to find the minimum path
}
```
The issue is that you have defined `main()` twice in your program. The first definition is on line 14, and the second is on line 29. You can only have one definition of `main()` in your program.

To fix this issue, simply remove one of the definitions of `main()`. I recommend removing the second definition, which is on line 29. This will allow your program to compile successfully.
