Modify the code as  The issue is with the function signature of `issame`. It takes two vectors as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are equal or not. However, in the test cases, it is being used as a function to compare the output of `minPath` with an expected result. This is causing the error.

To fix this, you can change the signature of `issame` to take three arguments: the first two are the vectors to be compared, and the third is the expected result. Then, inside the function, you can compare the two input vectors and return true if they are equal, or false otherwise.

Here's an example of how you could modify the code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool issame(vector<int> a, vector<int> b, vector<int> expected) {
    if (a.size() != b.size()) return false;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
        if (a[i] != b[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> v1 = {{1, 3}, {3, 2}};
    vector<int> v2 = {{1, 3}, {3, 2}};
    assert(issame(v1, v2, {{1, 3}, {3, 2}}) == true);
}
```
