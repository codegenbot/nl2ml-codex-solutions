```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool issame(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    return a == b;
}

vector<int> minPath(const vector<int>& costs, int target) {
    // Implement the function to find the minimum path
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> costs = {{1, 3}, {3, 2}};
    assert(issame(minPath(costs, 10), {1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3}));
}
```

The code has two issues:

1. The `std::vector` constructor used with an initializer list is not supported by the `new_allocator` class, which is the default allocator for `std::vector`. This can be fixed by using a different allocator that supports initializer lists, such as `std::allocator`, or by implementing the `_M_max_size()` function in your own custom allocator class.
2. The function call `issame(minPath({{1, 3}, {3, 2}}, 10)` is not valid because it tries to pass a brace-enclosed initializer list as an argument to the function, which is not allowed in C++. This can be fixed by changing the function call to `issame(minPath({1, 3}, {3, 2}), 10)`.

To fix the code, you should use a different allocator that supports initializer lists or implement the `_M_max_size()` function in your own custom allocator class. Additionally, you should change the function call to `issame(minPath({1, 3}, {3, 2}), 10)` to pass valid arguments to the `minPath` function.
