```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool issame(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    return a == b;
}

vector<int> minPath(const vector<int>& costs, int target) {
    // Implement the function to find the minimum path
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> costs = {{1, 3}, {3, 2}};
    assert(issame(minPath(costs, 10), {1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3}));
}
```

The issue is that the `new_allocator` class used by the `std::vector` doesn't have a member function `_M_max_size()`. This function is called by the `std::vector` constructor when initializing from an initializer list, and it is not implemented in the `new_allocator` class.

To fix this issue, you can either:

1. Use a different allocator that does have the `_M_max_size()` function, such as `std::allocator`.
2. Implement the `_M_max_size()` function in your own custom allocator class.
3. Avoid using initializer lists and instead use the `std::vector` constructor that takes a size and an optional value to initialize the elements.

You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
