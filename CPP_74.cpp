```
#include <vector>
#include <string>

bool issame(const vector<string>& a, const vector<string>& b) {
    if (a.size() != b.size()) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
        if (a[i] != b[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

vector<string> total_match(const vector<string>& a, const vector<string>& b) {
    // implement the function here
}

int main() {
    assert(issame(total_match({"this", "is", "a", "test"}, {""}), {}));
    return 0;
}
```

The issues with the code are:

1. The function `issame` is declared to take two parameters of type `const vector<string>&`, but it's being called with only one argument.
2. There is no variable named `b` in scope, so the call to `issame` is invalid.
3. The function `total_match` is not defined anywhere in the code.
4. The function `main` is redefined twice in the code.
5. The assertion in `main` is trying to call `total_match` with an empty vector, but it's not clear what this function is supposed to do or how it should be implemented.

To fix these issues, you could try implementing `total_match` as a separate function that takes two vectors of strings and returns a new vector containing the total match between them. You would also need to define `b` in `issame` and make sure that all the calls to `issame` are valid. Additionally, you should remove one of the definitions of `main` and make sure that the remaining definition is correct.
