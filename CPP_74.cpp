Modify the code as  
The issues with the code are:

1. Incorrect function signature: The `issame` function expects two vectors of strings as input, but the function is called with three arguments (a vector and two empty sets). To fix this, change the function call to pass in two vectors of strings, like this: `assert( issame( {"this"} , {}) == {} );`.
2. Undeclared variable 'b': The variable 'b' is not declared in the scope of the `issame` function. To fix this, declare the variable before using it, like this: `vector<string> b;`.
3. Expression list treated as compound expression in initializer: This error is caused by passing a vector as an argument to the `issame` function, which expects two vectors of strings. To fix this, change the call to pass in two vectors of strings, like this: `assert( issame( {"this"} , {}) == {} );`.
4. 'total_match' was not declared in this scope: This error is caused by using a variable that has not been declared. To fix this, declare the variable before using it, like this: `vector<string> total_match;`.
5. 'issame' cannot be used as a function: This error is caused by trying to call the `issame` function with more than two arguments. To fix this, change the call to pass in only two vectors of strings, like this: `assert( issame( {"this"} , {}) == {} );`.
6. '__assert_fail' was not declared in this scope: This error is caused by using a function that has not been declared. To fix this, declare the function before using it, like this: `void __assert_fail();`.

To fix these issues, you should change the code to match the following:
```
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool issame(const vector<string>& a, const vector<string>& b) {
    return a == b;
}

int main() {
    assert(issame({"this"}, {"this"}));
    return 0;
}
```.
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
