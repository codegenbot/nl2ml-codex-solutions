```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

int solution(vector<int> lst); // Forward declaration of solution function

int main() {
    vector<int> lst = {3, 13, 2, 9};
    assert (solution(lst) == 3);
    return 0;
}
```
Alternatively, you can use curly braces to enclose the code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

int solution(vector<int> lst); // Forward declaration of solution function

int main() {
    vector<int> lst = {3, 13, 2, 9};
    assert (solution(lst) == 3);
    return 0;
}
```
Modify the code as follows:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

int solution(vector<int> lst) {
    // Your code here
}

int main() {
    vector<int> lst = {3, 13, 2, 9};
    assert (solution(lst) == 3);
    return 0;
}
```
Note: The error message is indicating that there are multiple definitions of `main()` in your code. This is not allowed in C++ as there can only be one definition of each function. To fix this, you need to remove one of the definitions of `main()`. It looks like you have two copies of the same code for `main()`, so you can simply delete one of them and keep the other.

Additionally, the error message also mentions that there is a problem with the function call `solutions({3, 13, 2, 9})`. The function `solution()` is declared but not defined in your code, so you need to define it before calling it.
