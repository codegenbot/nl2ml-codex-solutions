```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

int solution(vector<int> lst); // Forward declaration of solution function

int main() {
    vector<int> lst = {3, 13, 2, 9};
    assert (solution(lst) == 3);
    return 0;
}
```

Modify the code as follows:

1. Add a semicolon at the end of the forward declaration of `solution`.
2. Remove the extra backtick character on line 14.
3. Remove the second definition of `main` and move its contents to the first definition of `main`.
4. Rename `solutions` to `solution` in line 18, as it appears that this is what was intended.

With these changes, the code should compile successfully.
