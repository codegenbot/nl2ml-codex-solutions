This is caused by the use of backticks (`) instead of single quotes (') to delimit the strings in the assertions.

   21 | int main(){
      |     ^~~~
This is caused by the fact that the function signature for main() has been defined twice in the code.

To fix the code, you should:
1. Replace all instances of backticks (`) with single quotes (') in the assertions.
2. Remove the duplicate definition of main().
3. Add a return statement at the end of the function body to return a value..
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
