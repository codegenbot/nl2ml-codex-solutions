        for (int i = 0; i < txt.size(); i++) {
            if (islower(txt[i])) {
                count++;

The issue is related to syntax errors in the code. The backticks (``) are used for multiline comments in C++, but they must be matched correctly, and there must not be any unmatched or stray backticks in the code. Additionally, the function `split` is not declared anywhere in the code snippet, which is causing an error.
To fix the code, you need to remove the extra backtick at the end of line 1 and line 25, and declare the `split` function somewhere in the code or use a different method to split the string.
