This code uses the `split` function, which is not declared or defined anywhere in the provided code snippet. To fix this, you can either:

1. Declare and define the `split` function before using it. This would involve adding a new function to the code that takes two string arguments (the input text and the delimiter) and returns a vector of strings containing the split words.
2. Use a different method to split the input text into words, such as the `std::string` class's built-in `find_first_of` or `find_last_of` functions, or a third-party library like Boost.StringAlgorithm.
3. If you are using C++17 or later, you can use the `std::string_view` class to split the input text into words without having to copy the entire string. This would involve creating a `std::string_view` object from the input text and then using its `find_first_of` or `find_last_of` functions to find the delimiters.

Here is an example of how you could implement the `split` function using the `std::string` class's built-in `find_first_of` function:
```
vector<string> split(const string& txt, const string& delimiter) {
    vector<string> words;
    size_t pos = 0;
    while (pos < txt.size()) {
        size_t start = pos;
        size_t end = txt.find(delimiter, pos);
        if (end == string::npos) {
            break;
        }
        words.push_back(txt.substr(start, end - start));
        pos = end + 1;
    }
    return words;
}
```
This function takes two string arguments: the input text and the delimiter to use for splitting. It returns a vector of strings containing the split words. The function uses the `std::string` class's built-in `find_first_of` function to find the position of the first occurrence of the delimiter in the input text, and then uses the `substr` function to extract the substring between the start and end positions. It repeats this process until it reaches the end of the input text.

Alternatively, you could use a third-party library like Boost.StringAlgorithm to split the input text into words. Here is an example of how you could do this:
```
#include <boost/algorithm/string.hpp>

vector<string> split_words(const string& txt) {
    vector<string> words;
    boost::split(words, txt, boost::is_any_of(" "));
    return words;
}
```
This function uses the `boost::split` function from the Boost.StringAlgorithm library to split the input text into words using a space character as the delimiter. It returns a vector of strings containing the split words.
