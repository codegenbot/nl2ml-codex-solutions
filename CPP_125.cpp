        for (int i = 0; i < txt.size(); i++) {
            if (islower(txt[i])) {
                count++;

The issue with the code is that the `split` function is not defined in the code snippet provided. The error message indicates that the function was not declared in the scope of the program, which suggests that it may be missing from the code or needs to be included as a library. To fix this issue, you can either define the `split` function yourself or include a library that provides it.

Here is an example of how you could define the `split` function:
```
vector<string> split(const string& str, const string& delim) {
    vector<string> words;
    size_t pos = 0;
    while ((pos = str.find(delim)) != string::npos) {
        words.push_back(str.substr(0, pos));
        str = str.substr(pos + delim.size());
    }
    return words;
}
```
Alternatively, you could include a library that provides the `split` function, such as the `boost` library. Here is an example of how you could use the `boost::split` function:
```
#include <boost/algorithm/string.hpp>

vector<string> split_words(string txt) {
    vector<string> words;
    boost::split(words, txt, boost::is_any_of(" "));
    return words;
}
```
