Modify the code as  The issue is that the `split` function is not declared or defined anywhere in the code. This function is used to split a string into substrings based on a delimiter, but it is not available in the standard library. To fix this issue, you can either declare and define your own `split` function or use an alternative method to achieve the same result.

Here's an example of how you could define your own `split` function:
```
#include <string>
#include <vector>

std::vector<std::string> split(const std::string& str, const std::string& delimiter) {
    std::vector<std::string> words;
    size_t pos = 0;
    while ((pos = str.find(delimiter, pos)) != std::string::npos) {
        words.push_back(str.substr(0, pos));
        pos += delimiter.length();
    }
    return words;
}
```
With this implementation, you can use the `split` function in your code as follows:
```
std::vector<std::string> words = split(txt, " ");
```
Alternatively, you could use a different method to achieve the same result, such as using the `std::istringstream` class to tokenize the input string. Here's an example of how you could do this:
```
#include <sstream>

std::vector<std::string> words;
std::istringstream iss(txt);
std::string word;
while (iss >> word) {
    words.push_back(word);
}
```
This code creates an `std::istringstream` object from the input string and then uses the `>>` operator to read each word from the stream into a separate string. The resulting vector of strings can be used in place of the original `words` variable in your code..
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
