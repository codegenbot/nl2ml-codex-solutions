```
Modify the code as  The issue is related to the use of `issame` as a function, which is not allowed in C++. To fix this, you can modify the code to call the `split_words` function with an empty string and check if it returns a vector containing only "0".
```
assert(split_words("") == std::vector<std::string>{"0"});
```.
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
``` 
Modify the code as  The error message is indicating that there are several issues with the code:

1. The `issame` function is not declared or defined, and it's being used as if it were a function.
2. The `split_words` function takes an argument of type `std::string&`, but it's being called with a string literal, which is not allowed in C++.
3. The `assert` statement is using the `issame` function, which is not defined or declared.

To fix the code, you should:

1. Define or declare the `issame` function before using it.
2. Change the call to `split_words` to pass a valid argument of type `std::string&`, for example by creating a variable of that type and passing it to the function.
3. Remove the call to `assert` and instead use an appropriate error handling mechanism, such as throwing an exception or returning an error code..
