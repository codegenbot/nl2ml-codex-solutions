Note that the code has been modified to use the correct syntax for declaring a function that takes two vectors as input and returns a boolean value. The `const` keyword has been added to indicate that the function does not modify the input vectors, and the `&` symbol has been added to indicate that the function takes references to the vectors rather than copies of them. This is more efficient and avoids unnecessary copying of data.

In addition, the call to `sort_array` in the assert statement has been fixed by removing the unnecessary parentheses around the argument list.
