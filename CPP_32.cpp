```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector> // Add this header file to use vector
using namespace std;

double find_zero(double x) {
    return 0; // TODO: implement this function
}

int main() {
    int ncoeff = 0;
    vector<double> coeffs;
    double solution = 0;
    while (ncoeff < 10) {
        cout << "Enter coefficient: ";
        cin >> ncoeff;
        coeffs.push_back(ncoeff);
    }
    solution = find_zero(coeffs[0]);
    assert(abs(poly(coeffs, solution)) < 1e-3);
}
```

In this code, the `new_allocator` class is used to manage the memory of the vector. However, the error message indicates that this allocator does not have a member named `_M_max_size`. This suggests that the issue is with the allocator used by the vector to manage its memory.

To fix this, you can try using a different allocator that has the required member functions, such as the `std::allocator` or `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator` from the C++17 standard library.

Here is an example of how to use the `std::allocator`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector> // Add this header file to use vector
using namespace std;

double find_zero(double x) {
    return 0; // TODO: implement this function
}

int main() {
    int ncoeff = 0;
    vector<double, std::allocator> coeffs;
    double solution = 0;
    while (ncoeff < 10) {
        cout << "Enter coefficient: ";
        cin >> ncoeff;
        coeffs.push_back(ncoeff);
    }
    solution = find_zero(coeffs[0]);
    assert(abs(poly(coeffs, solution)) < 1e-3);
}
```
In this example, the `std::allocator` is used to manage the memory of the vector. This allocator has the required member functions, such as `_M_max_size`, which should fix the issue with the previous code.
