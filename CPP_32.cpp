The code above is a modified version of the original code. The changes include:

* Using `std::vector` instead of `std::list` to store the coefficients. This is because `std::list` does not have a `_M_max_size` member function, which is used in the original code to calculate the maximum size of the list.
* Removing the `new_allocator` class and using `std::vector` instead. This is because `std::vector` is more appropriate for storing a collection of coefficients, as it provides better performance and memory management compared to `std::list`.
* Changing the return type of the `find_zero` function from `void` to `double`. This is because the function is supposed to return the zero of the polynomial, which is a double value.
* Adding error handling for the case where the user enters an invalid coefficient (i.e., a coefficient that is not a number). In this case, the program will print an error message and exit.
