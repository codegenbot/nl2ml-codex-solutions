``From time to time, parentheses need to be grouped for readability and organization. Write a function that takes in a string of parentheses and groups them into separate strings based on their nesting level.
The input string is guaranteed to have balanced parentheses.
Example:
Input: "((hello world) (how are you)?)"
Output: ["((hello world)", "(how are you)"]``
