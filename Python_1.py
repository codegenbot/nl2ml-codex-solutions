``From time to time, I need to work with strings of parentheses and spaces where the parentheses are grouped into sets like this: '((()))' or '(())()'. Write a function that takes such a string as input and returns a list of strings, each containing one group of parentheses. A group is defined as all occurrences of '(' followed by all occurrences of ')', not necessarily consecutive.
