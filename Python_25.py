The provided code is correct and does not require any modifications. It defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function then enters an infinite loop where it repeatedly asks the user to enter a positive integer, calls the `factorize` function with this input, prints the result, and breaks out of the loop once valid input is provided.
