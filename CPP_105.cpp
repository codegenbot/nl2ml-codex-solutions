```
#include <vector>
#include <string>

bool issame(const std::vector<std::string>& a, const std::vector<std::string>& b) {
    return a.size() == b.size() && std::equal(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin());
}

int by_length(const std::vector<std::string>& v) {
    int length = 0;
    for (const auto& s : v) {
        length += s.size();
    }
    return length;
}
```

The issue with the code is that there are two definitions of `main()` function, one with no arguments and another with an argument. The compiler is complaining about this redefinition. To fix this, you need to remove one of the `main()` functions or change its signature so that it doesn't conflict with the other definition.

Additionally, there are some issues with the `issame` function. It takes two arguments of type `const std::vector<std::string>&`, but it is not clear what these arguments represent. You need to provide more information about what this function should do and how it should be called.
