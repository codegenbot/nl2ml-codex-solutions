##### CPP/105. Problem description: Complete the following code given the task description and function signature..

Currently, the code is 
```
[PYTHON]
def get_unique_elements(my_list):
    return list(set(my_list))
[/PYTHON]
[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert get_unique_elements([]) == []
# Test case 2:
assert get_unique_elements([1]) == [1]
# Test case 3:
assert get_unique_elements([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == [1, 2, 3]
[/TESTS]

```
Modify the code as  The code has several issues:

1. The function `issame` is not defined. It is called in the `main` function but never declared or defined.
2. The variable `b` is used in the `issame` function, but it is not declared or defined anywhere.
3. The function `by_length` is also not defined. It is called in the `assert` statement but never declared or defined.
4. The `assert` statement is using a comparison operator (`==`) to compare two vectors of strings, which is not allowed in C++.

To fix the code, you should define all the functions and variables that are used in the code, including `issame`, `by_length`, and `b`. You should also use a valid comparison operator to compare the vectors of strings..
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
