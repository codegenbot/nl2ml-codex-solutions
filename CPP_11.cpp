#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << string_xor(a, b) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

It's worth noting that the original code had some formatting issues and extra backticks. I removed those and made sure the rest of the code is properly formatted.
