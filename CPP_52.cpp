Here's the corrected code:
```
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

bool below_threshold(vector<int>& l, int t) {
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
        if (l[i] >= t) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
The error message is indicating that there are stray backticks (`) in the program, which is causing compilation errors. To fix this issue, you need to remove those backticks from the code and ensure that it is formatted correctly.
