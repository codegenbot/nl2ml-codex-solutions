```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool belowThreshold(vector<int> l, int t) {
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
        if (l[i] > t) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
The issue was caused by the use of backticks (``) in the function and variable names, which is not allowed in C++. The error message indicated that there were stray backticks in the program, which means that the compiler encountered an unexpected backtick character while parsing the code. To fix this issue, I removed the backticks from the function and variable names, so that they are now valid identifiers in C++.
