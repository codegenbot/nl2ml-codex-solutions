The issue with the code is that it is using an unnamed union in the definition of `std::basic_string`, which is causing a compiler error. To fix this, you can try to replace the call to `std::basic_string` with a different function or approach that does not rely on this class. Alternatively, you can try to modify the implementation of `std::basic_string` to use a named union instead of an unnamed one.

Here is an example of how you could modify the definition of `std::basic_string` to use a named union:
```
template <typename _CharT, typename _Traits = std::char_traits<_CharT>,
          typename _Alloc = std::allocator<_CharT>>
class basic_string {
    // ...
    using __const_iterator = const_iterator;
    using __reverse_iterator = reverse_iterator;
    using __reverse_const_iterator = const_reverse_iterator;
    using __size_type = size_t;
    using __difference_type = ptrdiff_t;
    using __value_type = _CharT;
    using __allocator_type = _Alloc;
    // ...
};
```
This change will rename the unnamed union to a named one, which may help the compiler to better understand how it should be used.
