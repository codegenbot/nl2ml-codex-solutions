Modify the code as  The issue is caused by calling the `derivative` function with an initializer list as input, which is not supported by the function signature. The function expects a vector of floating-point numbers instead.

To fix the issue, simply replace the initializer list with a vector constructor:
```
vector<float> xs = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5};
```
becomes
```
vector<float> xs(3, 1, 2, 4, 5);
```.
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
