```
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<float> xs = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5};
    vector<float> ys = derivative(xs);
    for (auto x : ys) {
        cout << x << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The code above is using the `new` operator to allocate memory for the `xs` and `ys` vectors, but the allocator class `std::allocator<float>` does not have a member function `_M_max_size()` to determine the maximum size of the allocation. This suggests that you are using an older version of the C++ standard library (pre-C++17) which did not include this member function in the default allocator class.

To fix the issue, you can either:

1. Update your compiler and standard library to a newer version that includes the `_M_max_size()` member function in the `std::allocator<float>` class.
2. Use a different allocator class that does have the `_M_max_size()` member function, such as `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<float>`.
3. Avoid using the `new` operator and instead use a container class that manages its own memory allocation, such as `std::vector`.
