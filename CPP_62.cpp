```
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Declare derivative function
std::vector<float> derivative(const std::vector<float>& xs);

int main() {
    vector<float> xs = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5};
    vector<float> ys = derivative(xs);
    for (auto x : ys) {
        cout << x << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The issue is caused by the initializer list containing more elements than the vector can hold. To fix this, you can either:

1. Increase the capacity of the vector before passing it to the constructor using its `reserve()` method.
2. Use a different container that can handle larger arrays, such as a `std::deque` or a `std::list`.
3. Reduce the number of elements in the initializer list passed to the `vector` constructor.
