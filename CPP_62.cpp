The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the member function `_M_max_size()` in the class `new_allocator<float>`. This function is used to check if the requested allocation size exceeds the maximum allowed size for the allocator, and it is defined in the standard library.

To fix this error, you can try the following:

1. Make sure that your code includes the necessary headers, such as `<new>` or `<memory>`, which define the `new_allocator` class.
2. Check if there are any typos or syntax errors in your code that could be causing the compiler to not recognize the `_M_max_size()` function.
3. If you are using a custom allocator, make sure that it is defined correctly and that it has the necessary member functions, including `_M_max_size()`.
4. Try compiling your code with a different version of the standard library or compiler, as this error may be specific to a particular implementation.
