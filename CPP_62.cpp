```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<float> xs = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5};
    vector<float> ys = derivative(xs);
    for (auto x : ys) {
        cout << x << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The code above is a simple C++ program that computes the derivative of a set of input values using the `derivative` function. The `derivative` function takes a vector of input values and returns a vector of output values, where each output value is the derivative of the corresponding input value.

The code uses the `std::vector` class to store the input and output values, and the `std::cout` statement to print the output values to the console. The `main` function is the entry point for the program, and it calls the `derivative` function with the input vector as an argument.

The error message you are seeing suggests that the `new_allocator` class does not have a member function named `_M_max_size`. This is likely because you are using an older version of GCC that does not support this feature. To fix the issue, you can use the `-std=c++17` or `-std=c++2a` flag when compiling your code to enable C++17 or C++20 features, respectively. This should allow the code to compile without errors.
