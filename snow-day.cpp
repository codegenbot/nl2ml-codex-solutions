#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
float snow(int hours, float ground, float fall, float melt) {
    // Calculate the total amount of snow on the ground after each hour
    for (int i = 0; i < hours; i++) {
        ground += fall * (1 - pow(melt, i + 1));
    }
    return ground;
}
```

Note: I have used the formula for calculating the total amount of snow on the ground after each hour, which is given in the problem statement. The formula is based on the assumption that the amount of snow melting per hour is constant and equal to `melt`.
