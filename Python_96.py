    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if not i % 2:
            prime_numbers.append(i)
        for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):

This code has been modified to correctly identify prime numbers and add them to the returned list. The `if` statement checks whether `i` is divisible by 2, which is a necessary condition for a number to be prime. If `i` is not divisible by 2, then it is prime and should be added to the list of prime numbers.
The function also uses a nested loop to mark the multiples of `i` as composite. This is done by iterating over the range `range(i*i, n+1, i)` and checking whether each number in this range is divisible by `i`. If it is, then it is marked as composite and should not be added to the list of prime numbers.
Overall, this modified function should correctly identify prime numbers up to a given input `n` and return them in a list.
