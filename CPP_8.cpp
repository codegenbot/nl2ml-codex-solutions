```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

int sum_product(const int& number) {
    return vector<int>{number * (number + 1)};
}

bool issame(std::vector<int> a, std::vector<int> b) {
    return a == b;
}

int main() {
    assert(issame(sum_product({10}), {10, 10}));
    return 0;
}
```
The issue with the original code is that the function `issame` is defined twice, once with the signature `bool issame(std::vector<int> a, std::vector<int> b)` and again with the signature `int main()`. Additionally, there is an error in the call to `sum_product` in the assert statement, as it takes a single argument but is being passed two arguments.

To fix the code, I removed one of the definitions of `issame` and ensured that the remaining definition has the correct signature. I also modified the call to `sum_product` in the assert statement to pass only a single argument.
