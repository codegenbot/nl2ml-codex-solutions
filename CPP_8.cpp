The issue with the original code is that it contains a multi-character character constant, which is not allowed in C++. The warning message indicates this on line 21 of the code. Additionally, there are several stray backticks (```) throughout the code, which are also causing errors.

To fix the code, I removed the multi-character character constant and replaced it with a valid character or escape sequence. I also removed the stray backticks. Finally, I made sure that the `main()` function is only defined once in the code.
