```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

int sum_product(const int& number) {
    return vector<int>{number * (number + 1)};
}

bool issame(std::vector<int> a, std::vector<int> b) {
    return a == b;
}

int main() {
    assert(issame(sum_product({10}), {10, 10}));
    return 0;
}
```
The issue is that there are multiple definitions of `issame`, and the program is trying to redefine `main`. To fix this, you can:

1. Remove the duplicate definition of `issame` by removing one of the functions with the same name.
2. Change the name of one of the `issame` functions to avoid the conflict.
3. If you want to keep both definitions of `issame`, you need to specify which one you want to use in your program by using a namespace or a class.

You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
