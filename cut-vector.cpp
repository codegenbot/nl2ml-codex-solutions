Modify the code as The error message is indicating that the `return` statement on line 66 is trying to return an initializer list, which is not allowed for a function that returns a vector of integers. To fix this issue, you can change the return statement to use the `push_back()` method to add the elements of the left and right vectors to the result vector:
```
return {left.push_back(right), 0};
```
This will add the elements of the left and right vectors to the result vector, and then return it. The `0` is added as a placeholder for the second element of the result vector, which will be returned as a single element of type `int`.
