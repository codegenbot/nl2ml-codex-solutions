```
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

vector<int> cutVector(vector<int> v) {
    int n = v.size();
    if (n == 1) return vector<int>{v[0], 0};
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;
    int spot = -1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int diff = abs(v[i] - v[i-1]);
        if (diff < minDiff) {
            minDiff = diff;
            spot = i;
        }
    }
    return vector<int>{v[spot], v[spot+1]};
}
```
This code is a corrected version of the original code, it fixes all the issues mentioned in the problem description.

The first issue was an extra backtick at the beginning of the code, which has been removed.
The second issue was missing #include<climits> for INT_MAX definition, it has been added to fix this error.
The third issue was using INT_MAX without including <climits>, it has been fixed by adding #include<climits>.
The fourth issue was returning a vector with two elements when the function is declared to return a single integer, it has been fixed by changing the return type of the function to vector<int> or modifying the return statement to return a single integer.
The fifth issue was an extra backtick at the end of the code, which has been removed.
