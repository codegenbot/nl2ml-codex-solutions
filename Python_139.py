def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters
    which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.
    Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for
    adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as
    "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or
    "No 'x' in Nixon".

    For example:
    >>> is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!")
    True

    pass
    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
