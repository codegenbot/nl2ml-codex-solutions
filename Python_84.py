'''Write a Python program that reads an integer from user input and converts it into base64 encoding. If the number is negative, convert its absolute value to base64 and then prefix it with a minus sign. The output should be in uppercase. If the input is not an integer, treat it as a string and return the same string. If the input contains non-ASCII characters, encode them using UTF-8 encoding before converting to base64. On Windows platform, replace '+' character with '-'. If any error occurs during the process, print the error message and return None. The program should run in an infinite loop until a valid input is provided.'''
