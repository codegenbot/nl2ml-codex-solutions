    """Create a function which returns True if the given array can be rearranged
    to form a sequence which is strictly increasing from its first element up
    to its k-th element, followed by a sequence which is strictly decreasing
    from its k-th element up to its last element. In this case, the sequence
    from the first element up to the k-th element is called a strictly increasing
    sequence, and the sequence from the k-th element up to the last element is
    called a strictly decreasing sequence.
