```
#include <boost/any.hpp>
#include <string>

int main() {
    assert(boost::any_cast<std::string>(compare_one("1", 1)) == "None");
}
```

The issue is with the backticks (```) used to enclose the code snippet. The C++ compiler is not able to parse the code correctly due to these extra characters. To fix this, simply remove the backticks from the code snippet and try again.
