```
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```
The issue is caused by an invalid syntax in the program. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the indentation of the code. To fix this, you can try the following:

1. Check the indentation of the code and make sure it is consistent throughout the program. In Python, indentation is used to define blocks of code, so it's important to get it right.
2. Make sure there are no extra or missing spaces at the beginning of lines. Extra spaces can cause syntax errors, while missing spaces can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. Check for any unmatched parentheses, brackets, or braces. These can also cause syntax errors and make the code difficult to read.
4. If you're using a text editor or IDE with syntax highlighting, check that it is enabled and working correctly. This can help you identify syntax errors more easily.
5. If none of the above steps work, try running the program in a different environment or on a different machine. Sometimes, issues like this can be caused by specific configurations or versions of Python..
