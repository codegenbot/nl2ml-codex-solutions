```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <list>
using namespace std;

vector<int> filter_integers(std::list<boost::any> values) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& value : values) {
        if (value.type() == typeid(int)) {
            result.push_back(boost::any_cast<int>(value));
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

The issue is that the `boost::any` class is not found, which is required for using the `filter_integers` function. To fix this, you can either:

1. Install the Boost library on your system and add its include directory to your project's include path.
2. Replace the use of `boost::any` with a different data type that does not require an external library, such as `std::variant`.
3. Use a different approach altogether, such as using a vector of integers instead of a list of `boost::any` objects.
