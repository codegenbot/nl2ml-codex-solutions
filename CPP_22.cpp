```
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>

int main() {
    // Test the function with a list of integers and characters
    std::vector<list_any> values = {{3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'}};
    assert(is_same(filter_integers(values), {3, 3, 3}));
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
The code you provided has a few issues. Firstly, the function `main()` is defined multiple times in the file, which is not allowed in C++. To fix this, we can remove the duplicate definition of `main()` and make sure that only one instance of it exists in the file.

Secondly, the function `filter_integers` is used in the call to `issame`, but it is not declared or defined anywhere in the code. To fix this, we need to declare the function `filter_integers` before using it in the call to `issame`.

Once these issues are fixed, the code should compile and run correctly.
