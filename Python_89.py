def encrypt(s):
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    rotated_alphabet = alphabet[2:] + alphabet[:2]

```
This code is a Python function named `encrypt` that takes a string argument `s`. It first defines two strings: `alphabet`, which contains the lowercase letters of the English alphabet, and `rotated_alphabet`, which contains the same letters but with the first two letters (a and b) moved to the end.

The function then creates a translation table using the `str.maketrans()` method, which maps each letter in `alphabet` to its corresponding letter in `rotated_alphabet`. This is used to encrypt the input string `s` by replacing each letter with its encrypted equivalent using the `translate()` method.

Finally, the function uses a regular expression to remove any non-alphabetic characters from the encrypted string and returns the result.
