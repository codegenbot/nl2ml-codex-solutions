This code uses a stack to evaluate the Boolean expression. It iterates through each character in the expression and performs the following operations:

* If the character is 'T', it appends True to the stack.
* If the character is 'F', it appends False to the stack.
* If the character is '|', it pops the top two elements from the stack, performs a logical OR operation on them, and then pushes the result back onto the stack.
* If the character is '&', it pops the top two elements from the stack, performs a logical AND operation on them, and then pushes the result back onto the stack.

The final result is returned by popping the last element from the stack.
