```
This code uses a stack to evaluate the Boolean expression. It starts by iterating over each character in the input string, and for each character, it performs the following actions:

* If the character is 'T', it pushes True onto the stack.
* If the character is 'F', it pushes False onto the stack.
* If the character is '&', it pops the top two elements of the stack, and pushes the result of ANDing them onto the stack.
* If the character is '|', it pops the top two elements of the stack, and pushes the result of ORing them onto the stack.

Finally, it returns the last element on the stack, which should be the resulting Boolean value.
