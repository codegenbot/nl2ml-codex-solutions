Here is the solution for the problem:

```
def solve_boolean(s):
    stack = []
    result = False
    
    for c in s + ' ':  # Add a space at the end to ensure correct processing of the last operator
        if c == 't':
            result = True
        elif c == 'f':
            pass  # Just ignore this character
        elif c == '|':  # If we encounter '|', change the result if it's False
            result = not result
        elif c == '&':  # If we encounter '&', keep the current result and pop previous operators
            while stack and stack[-1] == '&':
                result &= stack.pop()
            stack.append('&')  # Push '&' onto the stack
        elif c == ' ':  # If we encounter a space, just pop all operators until we reach the '&' level
            while stack and stack[-1] != '&':
                if stack[-1] == '|':
                    result = not result
                stack.pop()
    
    return result
