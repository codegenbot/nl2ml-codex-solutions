The issue is caused by two possible implementations of the `issame` function with the same name and parameters, which causes an ambiguity error. To fix this, you can either:

1. Remove one of the definitions of the `issame` function to avoid the conflict.
2. Use a namespace or class to encapsulate one of the implementations to differentiate them.
3. Change the name of one of the functions to avoid the conflict.
4. Use a using declaration to explicitly specify which implementation you want to use.
5. Use a lambda function to create an anonymous function that takes two vectors as input and returns true if they are equal, false otherwise.

You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
