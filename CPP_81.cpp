```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

bool issame(const vector<string>& a, const vector<string>& b) {
    // Your implementation here
}

int main() {
    vector<double> grades = {0, 0.7};
    assert(issame(numerical_letter_grade(grades), {"E", "D-"}));
    return 0;
}
```

The code you provided contains several errors and issues that need to be addressed. Here are some suggestions on how to fix the code:

1. The function `numerical_letter_grade` is not defined anywhere in the code snippet you provided, yet it's being called in the assert statement in the `main` function. To fix this, define a function named `numerical_letter_grade` that takes a vector of double grades as input and returns a vector of string letter grades corresponding to those numeric values.
2. The assert statement in the `main` function is trying to compare two vectors with different types: `grades` and `"E", "D-"`. To fix this, you can modify the `issame` function to accept strings as well as doubles for its second parameter, or create a new function that compares strings.
3. There's a redefinition of the `main` function in the code snippet. This is likely a copy-paste error and should be removed.

To fix these issues, you can start by defining the `numerical_letter_grade` function and then modify the `issame` function to compare vectors with different types, if necessary. You can also remove the duplicate definition of the `main` function.
