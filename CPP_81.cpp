The error message is indicating that you're using an invalid field `_M_allocated_capacity` when destroying the vector of strings. This means that you're trying to access a field that doesn't exist in the vector.

To fix this issue, you can simply remove the `_M_allocated_capacity` field from your code. It is not needed and is causing the error. Your code should look like this:
```cpp
std::vector<std::pmr::string> numerical_letter_grade(const std::vector<float>& grades) {
    std::vector<std::pmr::string> result;
    for (const auto& grade : grades) {
        if (grade >= 90) {
            result.push_back("A");
        } else if (grade >= 80) {
            result.push_back("B");
        } else if (grade >= 70) {
            result.push_back("C");
        } else if (grade >= 60) {
            result.push_back("D");
        } else {
            result.push_back("F");
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
This should fix the issue and allow your code to compile correctly.
