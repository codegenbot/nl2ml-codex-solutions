```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool issame(vector<string> a, vector<string> b) {
    // Your implementation here
}

int main() {
    vector<double> grades = {0, 0.7};
    assert(issame(numerical_letter_grade(grades), {"E", "D-"}));
    return 0;
}
```

The code has several issues:

1. The function signature for `issame` is not correct, it should be `bool issame(vector<string> a, vector<string> b)`.
2. The function body of `issame` is missing.
3. In the `main` function, there are two definitions of `main`, one with an empty parameter list and another with no parameters. This is not allowed in C++.
4. In the `assert` statement, `numerical_letter_grade` is not defined.

To fix these issues:

1. Change the function signature for `issame` to match the expected one.
2. Add a function body for `issame`.
3. Remove the duplicate definition of `main`.
4. Define `numerical_letter_grade` or remove the call to it from the assert statement.
