```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool issame(vector<string> a, vector<string> b) {
    // Your implementation here
}

int main() {
    vector<double> grades = {0, 0.7};
    assert(issame(numerical_letter_grade(grades), {"E", "D-"}));
    return 0;
}
```

The code above has two issues:

1. Multiple definitions of the `issame` function and the `main` function, which is not allowed in C++. To fix this issue, you can remove one of the duplicate definitions and make sure that the remaining definition matches the expected signature for the function.
2. The error message mentions that the `numerical_letter_grade` function was not declared in this scope. This means that you need to declare or define this function before using it in your code. You can do this by adding a forward declaration of the function above the `main` function, like this:
```
bool numerical_letter_grade(std::vector<double> grades);
```
This will allow the compiler to recognize the `numerical_letter_grade` function and avoid the error message.
