```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

bool issame(const vector<string>& a, const vector<string>& b) {
    // Your implementation here
}

vector<string> numerical_letter_grade(const vector<double>& grades) {
    // Your implementation here
}

int main() {
    vector<double> grades = {0, 0.7};
    assert(issame(numerical_letter_grade(grades), {"E", "D-"}));
    return 0;
}
```

The issue is that there are two functions named `issame` with different signatures: one takes two `std::vector<std::string>` arguments and returns a `bool`, while the other takes two `const std::vector<std::string>&` arguments and also returns a `bool`. The compiler is unable to determine which function to call when you pass a brace-enclosed initializer list as an argument.

To fix this, you can either:

1. Remove one of the `issame` functions and only keep the one that takes two `std::vector<std::string>` arguments. This will allow the compiler to determine which function to call when you pass a brace-enclosed initializer list as an argument.
2. Change the signature of the `issame` function that takes two `const std::vector<std::string>&` arguments to take two `std::vector<std::string>` arguments instead. This will allow the compiler to determine which function to call when you pass a brace-enclosed initializer list as an argument, and it will also avoid the need for a temporary vector object to be created when passing the initializer list as an argument.

You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
