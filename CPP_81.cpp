```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

bool issame(const vector<string>& a, const vector<string>& b) {
    // Your implementation here
}

vector<string> numerical_letter_grade(const vector<double>& grades) {
    // Your implementation here
}

int main() {
    vector<double> grades = {0, 0.7};
    assert(issame(numerical_letter_grade(grades), {"E", "D-"}));
    return 0;
}
```

The issue is that there are two functions named `issame` with different signatures, and the compiler is unable to determine which one to use when calling it with a vector and an initializer list. One possible solution is to add another function overload that takes a vector and an initializer list as arguments, like this:
```
bool issame(const std::vector<std::string>& a, const std::initializer_list<std::string>& b) {
  // Your implementation here
}
```
With this overload added, the compiler will be able to determine which function to use when calling `issame` with a vector and an initializer list.
