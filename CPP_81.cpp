```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<string> numerical_letter_grade(const vector<int>&);

int main() {
    assert (issame(numerical_letter_grade({0, 0.7}) , {"E", "D-"}));
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The duplicate definition of `main()` has been removed. There should only be one `main()` function in your code.
2. The function signature for `numerical_letter_grade` has been declared before using it in `main()`. This tells the compiler that there is a function called `numerical_letter_grade` that takes a `vector<int>` and returns a `vector<string>`.
3. The necessary headers have been included in your code. You may need to add `#include <vector>` and `#include <string>` at the top of your file if they are not already included.
4. The syntax for `assert()` has been corrected. The statement should be written as `assert(condition, message)` where `condition` is a boolean expression and `message` is a string that will be printed if the condition is not met. You can also use `assert()` without a message by simply writing `assert(condition);`.

By making these changes, you should be able to compile and run your code successfully.
