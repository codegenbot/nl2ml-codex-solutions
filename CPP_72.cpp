Here is the completed code:

bool will_it_fly(vector<int> q, int w) {
    vector<int> v = q; // create a copy of the input vector
    reverse(v.begin(), v.end()); // reverse the vector to check for palindrome
    if (v != q) return false; // if reversed vector is not equal to original, it's unbalanced

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i : q) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum <= w && v == q; // check if sum is less than or equal to w and the vector is palindrome
}
