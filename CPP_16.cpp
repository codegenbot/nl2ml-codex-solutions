Modify the code as  
Based on your code and error message, it looks like you are trying to use the `std::stringstream` class without including the necessary header file (`<sstream>`). You can fix this by adding `#include <sstream>` at the top of your code. Additionally, you may need to qualify the `ss` variable with the `std::` namespace if it is not already in scope..
You must only return correct code. Remove any triple quotes, language name or explanations.
