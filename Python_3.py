Here's the completed `below_zero` function:

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero() -> None:
    operations = list(map(int, input("Enter your operations (space-separated): ").split()))
    balance = sum(operations)

    has_debt = input("Do you have any debt? (yes/no): ")
    
    if has_debt.lower() == "yes":
        while balance > 0:
            try:
                amount_to_pay = int(input("How much would you like to pay off today? "))
                if not isinstance(amount_to_pay, int) or amount_to_pay <= 0:
                    print("Invalid payment! Please enter a positive integer.")
                    continue
                balance -= amount_to_pay
                while balance < 0:  
                    try:
                        debt_payment = int(input("How much would you like to pay off today? "))
                        if not isinstance(debt_payment, int) or debt_payment <= 0:
                            print("Invalid payment! Please enter a positive integer.")
                            continue
                        balance += debt_payment  
                    except:
                        print("Debt cannot be paid off. Balance remains.")
            except:
                print("Debt cannot be paid off. Balance remains.")
        if balance == 0:
            print("Congratulations, your debt is paid off!")
        else:
            print("You still have debt to pay off!")
    else:

        elif balance > 0:
            print("No debt to pay off! You're in the green.")
        else:
            print("You're even. No debt, no credit.")
