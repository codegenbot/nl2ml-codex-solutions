Here is the modified code:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero() -> bool:
    operations = list(map(int, input("Enter integers separated by spaces: ").split()))
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance >= 0:
            return False
    return True

print(below_zero())
