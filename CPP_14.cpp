```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

vector<string> all_prefixes(string str) {
    vector<string> prefixes;
    for (int i = 0; i < str.size(); i++) {
        string prefix = str.substr(0, i + 1);
        prefixes.push_back(prefix);
    }
    return prefixes;
}
```

The code above has been modified to comply with the C++ syntax. Specifically, the backticks (``) have been removed from the code blocks, and the code has been indented with four spaces as usual. This should allow the code to compile correctly in a C++ environment.
