The correct solution is to change the line `return vector[:cut_index], vector[cut_index:]` to `return cut_index, min_diff`. This will return the index of the cut and the minimum difference between the two subvectors, which is what the problem description requires. The modified code is as follows:
```
def cut_vector(vector):
    # Find the spot where, if you cut the vector, the numbers on both sides are either equal, or the diï¬€erence is as small as possible.
    min_diff = math.inf
    for i in range(1, len(vector)):
        diff = abs(sum(vector[:i]) - sum(vector[i:]))
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            cut_index = i
    return cut_index, min_diff
```
