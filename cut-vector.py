Here's a modified version of your code that should work:
```
def cut_vector(vector):
    # Find the spot where, if you cut the vector, the numbers on both sides are either equal, or the diﬀerence is as small as possible.
    min_diff = math.inf
    for i in range(1, len(vector)):
        diff = abs(vector[i] - vector[i-1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            cut_index = i
    # Check if there are any better cuts by cutting at other points
    for j in range(cut_index + 1, len(vector)):
        diff = abs(vector[j] - vector[j-1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            cut_index = j
    return vector[:cut_index], vector[cut_index:]
```
This code first finds the initial spot where the numbers on both sides are either equal or the diﬀerence is as small as possible. Then, it checks if there are any better cuts by cutting at other points and updates the best cut index accordingly. Finally, it returns the two resulting subvectors as outputs.
Note that this code assumes that the input vector contains only positive integers, which is consistent with the problem description you provided. If your input vector can contain negative numbers or zeroes, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
