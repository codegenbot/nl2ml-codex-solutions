Explanation: The `cut_vector` function initializes an empty `vector` list to store the input positive integers. It repeatedly prompts the user to enter a positive integer and adds it to the `vector` list until a non-positive integer or empty input is given.

If the length of the `vector` list is less than 2, it means there are not enough numbers to cut. In such cases, it returns the `vector` list as the first subvector and a list containing a single element `[0]` as the second subvector.

Otherwise, it calculates the total sum of all numbers in the `vector` list and initializes `left_sum` as 0 and `right_sum` as the total sum. It then iterates through each number in the `vector` list and updates `left_sum` and `right_sum` accordingly.

If the `left_sum` is equal to the `right_sum` or the absolute difference between `left_sum` and `right_sum` is the minimum among the three options (the other two being `abs(left_sum - right_sum)` and `abs(total_sum - left_sum - right_sum)`), it means that this is the spot where cutting the vector would result in two subvectors satisfying the condition. In such cases, it returns the first subvector as `vector[:i+1]` and the second subvector as `vector[i+1:]`.

If no such spot is found, it means that cutting the vector at any spot would not satisfy the condition. In such cases, it returns the `vector` list as the first subvector and a list containing a single element `[0]` as the second subvector.
