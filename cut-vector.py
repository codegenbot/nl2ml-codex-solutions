Here is the solution in Python:

def cut_vector(nums):
    min_diff = float('inf')
    split_index = 0
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        diff = abs(sum(nums[:i]) - sum(nums[i:]))
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            split_index = i
    return nums[:split_index], nums[split_index:]
