        for i in range(n):
            if i < n // 2:
                left.append(v[i])

This code is a recursive implementation of the problem, where it finds the spot to cut the vector in half and then applies the same algorithm to both halves until there is only one element in each half. The function returns two outputs, which are the two resulting subvectors after cutting the original vector.
