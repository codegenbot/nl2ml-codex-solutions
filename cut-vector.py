The modified code is:
```
def cut_vector(vector):
    n = len(vector)
    if n == 1:
        return vector[0], 0
    elif n == 2:
        return vector[0], vector[1]
    else:
        min_diff = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n):
            diff = abs(sum(vector[:i]) - sum(vector[i:]))
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                cut = i
        return vector[:cut], vector[cut:]
```
This code is more concise and easier to read. It also avoids the use of the `math.inf` constant, which can be problematic in some cases. Instead, it uses the built-in `float('inf')` function to represent infinity.
