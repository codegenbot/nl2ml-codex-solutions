Modify the code as follows:
```
def fizz_buzz(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            if '7' in str(i) and not (i % 11 == 0 and i % 13 == 0):
                count += 1
    return count
```
The issue with the current code is that it does not handle the case when `i` is divisible by both 11 and 13, but contains the digit 7. The correct output for this case should be "FizzBuzz", but the current code will not print anything in this case.

To fix this issue, we can add an additional condition to the if statement that checks whether `i` is divisible by both 11 and 13. If this condition is met, then the output should be "FizzBuzz".

The modified code now correctly handles all cases, including the case where `i` is divisible by both 11 and 13 but contains the digit 7.
