The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers (SINs). The formula works by multiplying every other digit by 2, starting with the second-to-last digit, and then adding up all the digits. If the total modulo 10 is 0, then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula.

Here is an example of how you can implement this algorithm in Python:
```
def luhn_check(credit_card_number):
    """
    The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers (SINs). 
    
    Args:
        credit_card_number (str): The credit card number to validate.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the credit card number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm, False otherwise.
    """
    digits = [int(x) for x in str(credit_card_number)]
    odd_digits = digits[-1::-2]
    even_digits = digits[-2::-2]
    total = sum(odd_digits)
    for digit in even_digits:
        total += digit * 2
    return total % 10 == 0
```
The Luhn algorithm is a simple and effective method for validating credit card numbers. However, it's important to note that this algorithm only checks the format of the number, not its authenticity. It's also worth mentioning that this algorithm assumes that the credit card number is passed as a string of digits, if you need to pass other types of data you might need to modify the code accordingly.
