The problem description is asking for the probability that Peter rolls strictly higher than Colin. To calculate this, we can use the following formula:

P(Peter rolls higher) = P(Peter rolls i) - P(Colin rolls i)

where i is the number of sides on the dice.

We can simplify this formula by noticing that the probability of Colin rolling a specific number is equal to 1/m, since there are m possible outcomes for Colin's roll. Therefore, we can write:

P(Peter rolls higher) = P(Peter rolls i) - 1/m

We know that Peter's probability of rolling i is (i-1)/(n*m), since there are n*m possible outcomes for Peter's roll. Therefore, we can substitute this into the formula:

P(Peter rolls higher) = (i-1)/(n*m) - 1/m

Simplifying and simplifying further, we get:

P(Peter rolls higher) = (i-1)/(n*m) - 1/(n*m)

This is the same as the formula in the code snippet. Therefore, the code is correct.
