def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """
    Returns a new list where every third element is sorted and all other elements remain the same.

    If an index is not divisible by three, it remains unchanged in the output. If an index is
    divisible by three, all subsequent elements at that multiple of three (and following)
    are sorted in reverse order before being placed at their original position in the output.

    Parameters:
    l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
    list: The modified list where every third element is sorted.
