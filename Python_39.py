```
def prime_fib(n: int):
    fib = [0, 1]
    while len(fib) <= n:
        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])
    return next((x for x in fib if isprime(x)), None)
```
The code above is the solution to the problem. It defines a function `prime_fib` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the first prime number in the Fibonacci sequence greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a list comprehension to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to `n`, and then checks each element of the sequence for primality using the `isprime` function. If no prime numbers are found, the function returns `None`.

The error message you are seeing indicates that there is an issue with the `isprime` function, which is not defined anywhere in your code. You will need to define this function or use a different method to determine if a number is prime.
