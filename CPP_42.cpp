Modify the code as  The error message is saying that there are multiple definitions of `main()` in the file, which is not allowed in C++. To fix this issue, you can delete one of the `int main()` functions and keep only one. You may also need to delete the corresponding closing brace `}` for the deleted function. Additionally, the error message mentions an undeclared identifier `incr_list` and a function call `issame(incr_list(...))` that cannot be used as a function. To fix this issue, you can declare the `incr_list` variable and pass it to the `issame` function as an argument, like this:
```
assert (issame({6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124}, incr_list({5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123})) == true);
```
Note that the `issame` function should take two arguments of type `std::vector<int>`, and return a value of type `bool`.
