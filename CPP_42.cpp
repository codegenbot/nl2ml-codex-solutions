```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v;
    v.push_back(1);
    v.push_back(2);
    v.push_back(3);
    for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
        if (*it % 2 == 0) {
            std::cout << *it << " ";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
The issue is that there are two definitions of `main()` function, one in line 6 and another on line 21. To fix this issue, you can remove one of the `main()` functions, either the one on line 6 or the one on line 21, depending on which one is not needed for your code. Additionally, there is an error message saying that `incr_list` was not declared in this scope. You will need to declare it before using it.

Here's the corrected code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v;
    v.push_back(1);
    v.push_back(2);
    v.push_back(3);
    for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
        if (*it % 2 == 0) {
            std::cout << *it << " ";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
