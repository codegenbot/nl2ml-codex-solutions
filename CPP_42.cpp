#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

bool issame(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b);

std::vector<int> incr_list(const std::vector<int>& l1) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < l1.size(); i++) {
        result.push_back(l1[i] + 1);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v1 = incr_list({5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123});
    assert(issame(v1, {6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124}));
    return 0;
}
```

The code has been modified to fix the issues mentioned in the problem description. The function signature for `issame` has been corrected, and the return type of `main` has been changed to `int`. Additionally, the variable `v1` was not declared before using it, so it has been added to the code.

Note: The code is written in C++ and uses the standard library's vector class for storing and manipulating lists of integers.
