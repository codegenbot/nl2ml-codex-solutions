```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v1 = {5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123};
    std::vector<int> v2 = {6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124};
    assert(std::equal(v1.begin(), v1.end(), v2.begin()));
    return 0;
}
```

The code above is a simple C++ program that defines two vectors `v1` and `v2`, and then uses the `assert()` function to check if the elements of `v1` are equal to the elements of `v2`. If they are not equal, the program will terminate with an error message.

The problem is that there are two definitions of the `main()` function in the code, one on line 5 and another on line 22. C++ does not allow for multiple definitions of functions with the same name. To fix this issue, you can either:

1. Change the name of the second `main()` function to something else, like `int issame(vector<int> a, vector<int> b)`. This will create a new function called `issame` that takes two vectors as arguments and returns an integer value.
2. Remove the second definition of `main()` and only keep the first one. This way, your code will only have one definition of the `main()` function.
