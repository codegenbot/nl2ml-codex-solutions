```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

bool simplify(int x, int n) {
    // ...
}

int main() {
    string x = "1/5";
    string n = "5/1";
    int x_int = stoi(x);
    int n_int = stoi(n);
    cout << simplify(x_int, n_int) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The issue is caused by trying to use the `insert` method of the `std::basic_string<char>` class with an `int` argument, which is not allowed. The `insert` method expects a `const_iterator` as its first argument, which is why you're getting the error message about no known conversion from `int` to `const_iterator`.

To fix this, simply use the appropriate overload of the `insert` method that takes an `int` as its second argument. For example:
```cpp
// Before:
simplify(x_int, n_int);

// After:
simplify(x_int, n_int, 0);
```
This will insert the value of `n_int` into the string at index 0. Note that this assumes that you have already checked that the input strings are valid and contain only digits. If not, you may want to add additional checks before attempting to simplify the expression.
