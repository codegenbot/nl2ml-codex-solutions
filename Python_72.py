def will_it_fly(q,w):
    '''
    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

    Example:
    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False 
    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.
    
def delete_numbers_divisible_by(x1, x2):
    for i in range(len(numbers)-1,0,-1):
        if numbers[i]%2==0:
            del numbers[i : i+x2]
        else:
            del numbers[i-x1 : i]
    returnlen(numbers)

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
