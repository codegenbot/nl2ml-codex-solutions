### Problem: Find Pair

**Problem Description:** Given a vector of integers, return the two elements that sum to a target integer.

**Input:** A vector of integers and a target integer.

**Output:** The two elements in the input vector that sum to the target integer. If there are multiple pairs that sum to the target, return any one of them. If there is no pair that sums to the target, return an empty vector.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], target = 5
Output: [1,4] or [2,3]
Explanation: The pairs that sum to 5 are [1,4] and [2,3].
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 6
Output: []
Explanation: There is no pair in the input vector that sums to 6.
```
**Constraints:**

* `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
* `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`

### Approach

We can use a two-pointer approach to solve this problem. We will start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, initialized to the beginning and end of the input vector respectively. We will then iterate through the input vector until we find a pair that sums to the target integer. If there is no such pair, we will return an empty vector.
```
vector<int> findPair(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    vector<int> result;
    int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            result.push_back(nums[left]);
            result.push_back(nums[right]);
            return result;
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis

* **Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input vector. We iterate through the entire vector once to find a pair that sums to the target integer.
* **Space complexity:** O(1), since we only need to store the two pointers and the result vector, which has a fixed size.
