#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// ... (your code here)

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int target = 7;
    std::cout << "The two elements that sum to " << target << " are: ";
    std::vector<int> result = findPair(nums, target);
    for (auto it : result) {
        std::cout << it << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This code defines a `main` function that creates a vector of integers and sets the target value to 7. It then calls the `findPair` function with the appropriate arguments and prints the result. The `for` loop iterates over the elements in the `result` vector and prints each element on a separate line.

Note that this code assumes that you have already defined the `findPair` function as described in your original post. If you haven't done so, you will need to add the definition of the `findPair` function to your program before you can compile it successfully..
