The issue with the original code is that it returns the values of the two elements that sum to the target, rather than their indices. To fix this, we can modify the `findPair` function to return a pair of integers representing the indices of the two elements, like this:
```
vector<int> findPair(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                result.push_back(i);
                result.push_back(j);
                return result;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
This will return a pair of integers representing the indices of the two elements that sum to the target, which is what the problem description asks for.
