The issue with the current code is that it returns the values of the two elements that sum to the target, but the problem statement requires returning their indices instead. To fix this, we can modify the `findPair` function to return a pair of integers representing the indices of the two elements, like so:
```
vector<int> findPair(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                result.push_back(i);
                result.push_back(j);
                return result;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
This code will now return a pair of integers representing the indices of the two elements that sum to the target, which is what the problem statement asks for.
