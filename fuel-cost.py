Here is the Python solution for the problem:

def fuel_cost(vector):
    return sum((i // 3) - 2 for i in vector)

# Test cases
print(fuel_cost([1])) # Output: 0
print(fuel_cost([6])) # Output: 0
print(fuel_cost([7])) # Output: 0
print(fuel_cost([8])) # Output: 0
print(fuel_cost([9])) # Output: 1
print(fuel_cost([10])) # Output: 1
