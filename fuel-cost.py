I will write a function called `fuel_cost` that takes a vector of positive integers as input and returns the sum of the new integers. Here is the code:

```python
def fuel_cost(nums):
    return sum([max(0, n // 3 - 2) for n in nums])
```

This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input vector. For each number `n`, we divide it by 3, round down to the nearest integer using the floor division operator `//`, subtract 2, and take the maximum of 0 and the result. This ensures that negative numbers are replaced with 0. Finally, we use the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of all the new integers.

Note: This solution assumes that the input vector is a Python list.
