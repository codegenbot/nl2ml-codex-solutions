Here is the completed Python code for the problem:

def fuel_cost(vector):
    return sum((num // 3 - 2) for num in vector)

# Example usage:
vector = [1, 6]
print(fuel_cost(vector))  # Output: 0
vector = [1, 7]
print(fuel_cost(vector))  # Output: 0
vector = [1, 8]
print(fuel_cost(vector))  # Output: 0
vector = [1, 9]
print(fuel_cost(vector))  # Output: 1
vector = [1, 10]
print(fuel_cost(vector))  # Output: 1
