```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Your code here
}
```
You can also add the missing include directives for the standard library headers at the top of the file, like this:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
```
This will allow you to use the standard library functions and types in your code.
