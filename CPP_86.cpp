Explanation:

1. The `main()` function is defined twice in the original code, which is not allowed in C++. To fix this, we can remove one of the definitions.
2. The `anti_shuffle` function has a syntax error because it is missing a semicolon at the end of the function body and has an extra closing brace. To fix this, we can add a semicolon at the end of the function body and remove the extra closing brace.
3. The `swap` function is not defined in the original code, which is used in the `anti_shuffle` function. To fix this, we can define the `swap` function before using it in the `anti_shuffle` function.
4. The comparison in the assert statement is invalid because it is comparing a string with a non-string value (the result of the `anti_shuffle` function call). To fix this, we can change the comparison to compare the result of the `anti_shuffle` function call with a string value instead of a non-string value.
