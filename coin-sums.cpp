The issue with your current code is that you are not handling the case where the number of cents is greater than 25 but less than 100. In this case, you need to add a quarter (25 cents) and then subtract 25 from the remaining amount. Your current code only handles the cases where the number of cents is exactly 25 or less than 25.

To fix this issue, I modified your code to handle the case where the number of cents is greater than 25 but less than 100. In this modified version, if the number of cents is greater than 25 and less than 100, we add a quarter (25 cents) to the output and then subtract 25 from the remaining amount.

Here is the modified code:
```
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstring>
#include <queue>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <stack>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;
/*
Given a number of cents, ﬁnd the fewest number of US coins (pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters) needed to make that amount, and return the number of each type of coin as a separate output.
For example,
input:
1
output:
1
0
0
0
input:
2
output:
2
0
0
0
input:
3
output:
3
0
0
0
input:
4
output:
4
0
0
0
input:
5
output:
0
1
0
0
*/
int main() {
    int cents;
    cin >> cents;
    vector<int> coins(4, 0);
    while (cents > 0) {
        if (cents >= 25) {
            coins[3]++;
            cents -= 25;
        } else if (cents >= 10 && cents < 25) {
            coins[2]++;
            cents -= 10;
        } else if (cents >= 5 && cents < 10) {
            coins[1]++;
            cents -= 5;
        } else {
            coins[0]++;
            cents = 0;
        }
    }
    cout << coins[0] << " " << coins[1] << " " << coins[2] << " " << coins[3] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This code should now handle the case where the number of cents is greater than 25 but less than 100 correctly.
