Solution:  The current implementation of `get_max_triples` function is not returning the correct output for input `n=100`. To solve this issue, we can modify the logic of the function to use a set data structure to keep track of unique triangles instead of using nested loops.

The modified version of the code is below:
```py
def get_max_triples(n):
    """ Returns the maximum number of triangles for n points on an (x, y) plane. """
    
    # Initialize a set to store unique triangles
    unique_triangles = set()
    
    # Iterate over each point in the list of input points
    for i in range(len(points)):
        # Get the current point and its x, y coordinates
        point = points[i]
        x = point.x
        y = point.y
        
        # Check if the point is already in the set of unique triangles
        if (x, y) not in unique_triangles:
            # If it's not, add it to the set and create a new triangle with it as one vertex
            unique_triangles.add((x, y))
            triangle = [point]
            
            # Iterate over each point after the current point
            for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
                # Get the second point and its x, y coordinates
                point2 = points[j]
                x2 = point2.x
                y2 = point2.y
                
                # Check if the second point is already in the set of unique triangles
                if (x2, y2) not in unique_triangles:
                    # If it's not, add it to the set and create a new triangle with it as the second vertex
                    unique_triangles.add((x2, y2))
                    triangle.append(point2)
                    
                    # Iterate over each point after the second point
                    for k in range(j + 1, len(points)):
                        # Get the third point and its x, y coordinates
                        point3 = points[k]
                        x3 = point3.x
                        y3 = point3.y
                        
                        # Check if the third point is already in the set of unique triangles
                        if (x3, y3) not in unique_triangles:
                            # If it's not, add it to the set and create a new triangle with it as the third vertex
                            unique_triangles.add((x3, y3))
                            triangle.append(point3)
    
    return len(unique_triangles)
