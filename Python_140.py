>> The issue with the current code is that it does not correctly replace all whitespace characters with underscores. To fix this, we need to modify the regular expression used by `re.sub` to match any number of consecutive whitespace characters.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    return re.sub(r"\s+", "_", text)
```
The regular expression `\s+` matches one or more consecutive whitespace characters, which is what we want to replace with underscores..
