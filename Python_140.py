```
import re
def fix_spaces(text):
    return re.sub(r"\s+", "_", text)
```
This code replaces multiple spaces with a single underscore in the given text. The regular expression `\s+` matches any whitespace character, including newlines and tabs, in addition to spaces. To fix this, we can change the regular expression to only match spaces:
```
import re
def fix_spaces(text):
    return re.sub(r"[ ]+", "_", text)
```
This will ensure that only spaces are replaced with underscores and not any other whitespace characters.
