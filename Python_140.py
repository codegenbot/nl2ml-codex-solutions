```
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    return re.sub(r"\s+", "_", text)
```
The issue is with the `re.sub` function. It takes two arguments, but you are only passing one. You need to pass the second argument as well.

Here's the corrected code:
```
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    return re.sub(r"\s+", "_", text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
```
In this code, I added a new parameter `flags` to the `re.sub` function and set it to `re.MULTILINE`. This flag tells the regular expression engine to match multiple lines of input.
