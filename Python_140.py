The issue is that the function `fix_spaces` is not working correctly. It is supposed to replace all spaces with underscores, but it is only replacing some of them. To fix this, you can modify the regular expression used by `re.sub` to match any number of consecutive spaces and replace them with a single underscore. Here's an example:
```
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    return re.sub(r"\s+", "_", text)
```
