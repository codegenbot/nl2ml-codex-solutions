Here is the completed code:

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * N for _ in range(N)]
    path = []
    
    def dfs(i, j, current_path):
        nonlocal path
        if len(current_path) == k:
            path = current_path
            return True
        
        visited[i][j] = True
        for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]:
            if 0 <= x < N and 0 <= y < N and not visited[x][y]:
                dfs(x, y, current_path + [grid[i][j]])
        visited[i][j] = False
        
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if not visited[i][j]:
                dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])
    
    return path
