Modify the code as follows:
```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    # Initialize variables
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    path = []

    # Define a function to find the minimum path
    def findMinPath(i, j, k):
        if not (0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m) or visited[i][j]:
            return float('inf')

        visited[i][j] = True
        min_path = min(findMinPath(i-1, j, k), findMinPath(i+1, j, k), findMinPath(i, j-1, k), findMinPath(i, j+1, k)) + grid[i][j]
        visited[i][j] = False

        return min_path

    # Find the minimum path
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not visited[i][j]:
                path.append(findMinPath(i, j, k))

    # Return the total cost of the minimum path
    return sum(path)
```
The issue with the original code was that it returned a list of values on the cells that the minimum path went through, but the expected output for the given input was a single value representing the total cost of the minimum path. To fix this, we modified the function to return the total cost of the minimum path instead of the list of values on the cells that the path goes through. We did this by changing the line `return sorted(path)` to `return sum(path)`. This will return the total cost of the minimum path, which is what the expected output is looking for.
