Here is the completed code:

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    path = []
    min_path_value = None

    def dfs(i, j, current_path):
        nonlocal min_path_value
        nonlocal path
        if len(current_path) == k:
            if not min_path_value or current_path < min_path_value:
                min_path_value = current_path[:]
                path = current_path[:]
            return
        visited[i][j] = True
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and not visited[ni][nj]:
                dfs(ni, nj, current_path + [grid[ni][nj]])
        visited[i][j] = False

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])

    return path
