Here is the completed Python code:

```
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    visited = [[False]*n for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    
    def dfs(i, j, path):
        if len(path) == k:
            return path
        visited[i][j] = True
        min_path = None
        for dx, dy in directions:
            ni, nj = i+dx, j+dy
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and not visited[ni][nj]:
                p = dfs(ni, nj, path + [grid[i][j]])
                if min_path is None or p < min_path:
                    min_path = p
        visited[i][j] = False
        return min_path
    
    min_path = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            p = dfs(i, j, [])
            if min_path is None or p < min_path:
                min_path = p
    return min_path
