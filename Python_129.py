Here is the completed code:

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    visited = [[False]*N for _ in range(N)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

    def dfs(i, j, path, k):
        if k == 0:
            return path
        visited[i][j] = True
        for direction in directions:
            new_i, new_j = i + direction[0], j + direction[1]
            if 0 <= new_i < N and 0 <= new_j < N and not visited[new_i][new_j]:
                new_path = dfs(new_i, new_j, path + [grid[i][j]], k - 1)
                if new_path:
                    return new_path
        visited[i][j] = False
        return None

    min_path = []
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            path = dfs(i, j, [], k)
            if path and (not min_path or path < min_path):
                min_path = path
    return min_path
