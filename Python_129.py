Here is the completed code:

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False]*m for _ in range(n)]
    path = []
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

    def dfs(i, j):
        if k == 0:
            return path
        if visited[i][j]:
            return None
        visited[i][j] = True
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni, nj = i+di, j+dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m:
                dfs(ni, nj)
        path.append(grid[i][j])
        return path

    min_path = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            path = dfs(i, j)
            if k == len(path) and (min_path is None or path < min_path):
                min_path = path
    return min_path
