Here is the completed code:

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * N for _ in range(N)]
    path = []

    def dfs(i, j, current_path):
        nonlocal path
        if len(current_path) == k:
            path = sorted(list(set(current_path)))
            return True
        visited[i][j] = True
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and not visited[ni][nj]:
                dfs(ni, nj, current_path + [grid[i][j]])
        visited[i][j] = False

    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if not visited[i][j]:
                dfs(i, j, [])

    return path
