def minPath(grid, k):

    Complete this function to return the shortest path from the cell containing k to the 
    nearest cell with value 0 in a grid.

    Parameters:
    grid (list): A list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the grid.
    k (int): The target value to search for.

    Returns:
    list: A list representing the shortest path from the cell containing k to the 
          nearest cell with value 0. If no such path is found, return None.
