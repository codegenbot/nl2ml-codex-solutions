Here is the solution:

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    m = [[i for _ in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            m[i][j] = grid[i][j]
    
    def dfs(i, j, path, visited, k):
        if k == 0:
            return path
        if (i, j) in visited:
            return None
        visited.add((i, j))
        min_path = None
        for x, y in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            new_i, new_j = i + x, j + y
            if 0 <= new_i < n and 0 <= new_j < n and (new_i, new_j) not in visited:
                new_path = dfs(new_i, new_j, path + [m[i][j]], visited.copy(), k - 1)
                if new_path is not None and (min_path is None or m[new_i][new_j] < min_path[-1]):
                    min_path = new_path
        return min_path
    
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            path = dfs(i, j, [], set(), k)
            if path and (res is None or m[path[0]][path[0]] < res[-1]):
                res = path
    return res
