```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `sort` function is not declared, so we need to include the `<algorithm>` header file and use the `std::sort` function instead of just `sort`.
2. The `main` function is defined twice, which is not allowed in C++, so we should remove one of the definitions.
3. The `pluck` function is not declared, so we need to define it or use a different function that performs the same operation.
4. The `issame` function is not declared, so we need to define it or use a different function that performs the same operation.

To fix the code, we should include the `<algorithm>` header file and use the `std::sort` function instead of just `sort`. We should also remove one of the definitions of the `main` function and define the `pluck` and `issame` functions or use different functions that perform the same operation.
