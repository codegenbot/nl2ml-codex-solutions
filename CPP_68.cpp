    vector<int> arr1{7, 9, 7, 1};
    vector<int> arr2{7, 9, 7, 1};
    if (issame(arr1, arr2)) {
        cout << "The two arrays are the same." << endl;

Explanation:

In the original code, the function `pluck` takes a vector as an argument by reference, but the argument passed to it is not a variable, but rather a temporary object created by the initializer list `{7, 9, 7, 1}`. This is not allowed because the reference cannot bind to a temporary object.

To fix this issue, we can either create a variable that holds the vector and pass that variable as an argument to `pluck`, or we can change the function signature of `pluck` to take a const reference instead of a non-const reference.

In this solution, I have chosen to change the function signature of `pluck` to take a const reference instead of a non-const reference. This allows us to pass a temporary object as an argument to the function without violating the rules of references.
