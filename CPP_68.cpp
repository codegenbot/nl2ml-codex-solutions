```
vector<int> pluck(vector<int> arr) {
    int smallestEven = INT_MAX;
    int smallestIndex = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i] % 2 == 0 && arr[i] <= smallestEven) {
            smallestEven = arr[i];
            smallestIndex = i;
        }
    }

    return {smallestEven, smallestIndex};
}
```

Explanation:
The code is modified to match the task description. The function signature is changed to take an array of integers and return a pair of integers representing the smallest even number and its index. The implementation is also adjusted accordingly. Finally, the syntax errors are fixed by adding or removing parentheses as needed to ensure that the code compiles correctly.
