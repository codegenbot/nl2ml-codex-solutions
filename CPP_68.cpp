The issue is that the `pluck` function requires two arguments: a vector and an integer index. However, the call to `issame(pluck({7, 9, 7, 1}) , {})` only provides one argument (a vector). To fix this, you need to pass the correct index as the second argument in the call to `pluck`. For example:
```
assert(issame(pluck({7, 9, 7, 1}, 0), {}));
```
