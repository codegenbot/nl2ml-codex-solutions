def sum_squares(lst):
    """"
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126


def find_max(lst):

    This function will take a list of integers. The function shall return the index of the maximum entry in the list. 
    If there are multiple entries of maximum value, the function shall return the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value. 
    If the list is empty, the function shall return -1.
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 2
    For lst = []  the output should be -1
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be 2
