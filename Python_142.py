def sum_squares(lst):
    """"
    This function will take a list of integers lst. 
    
    It will perform the following operations on the list. 
    
    1) Square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. 
    2) It will then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126
    output = 0

    return output
