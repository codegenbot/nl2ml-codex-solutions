Here is the completed code:

def find_zero(xs: list):
    n = len(xs)
    if n % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("xs must have even number of coefficients")
    a = xs[0]
    b = xs[1]
    c = xs[2] if n > 2 else 0
    d = xs[3] if n > 3 else 0
    x = -b / (2 * c) + math.sqrt((b / (2 * c))**2 - a + d) / c
    return round(x, 2)
