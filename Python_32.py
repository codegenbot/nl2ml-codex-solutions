Here is the completed code:

def find_zero(xs: list):
    n = len(xs)
    if n % 2 != 0:
        return "Error: The number of coefficients must be even"
    a = xs[1]
    b = -xs[0]
    c = xs[0] * xs[1] + xs[3:]  # [1:] to remove the first and last elements
    x = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
    return round(x, 10)
