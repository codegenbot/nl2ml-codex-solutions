Here is the completed code:

def find_zero(xs: list):
    if len(xs) % 2 != 0:
        return "Error: xs must have an even number of coefficients"
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        if abs(xs[i]) > abs(xs[0]):
            x = -xs[0] / xs[i]
            return round(x, 2)
    return "Error: largest non zero coefficient is not a variable"
