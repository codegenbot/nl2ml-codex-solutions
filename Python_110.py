    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.

    # Complete the following code given the task description and function signature.

    # Hint: You may want to create a new list to store the new lst1.
    # Hint: You may want to use a loop to move all the even numbers from lst2 to lst1.
    # Hint: You may want to use a loop to check whether all the elements in lst1 are even.
    # Hint: You may want to use a loop to move all the odd numbers from lst1 to lst2.
