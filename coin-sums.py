The code is almost correct, but there are a few issues:

1. The `coins` variable should be initialized as `[1, 5, 10, 25]` instead of `[1, 5, 10]`.
2. The loop variable `i` should start at 1 instead of 0, since the first element in the `coins` array is not a valid coin type.
3. The return statement should be `return counts[0], counts[1], counts[2], counts[3]`, to match the format specified in the problem description.
4. The indentation of the code is inconsistent, with some lines indented more than others. It's important to keep a consistent indentation style throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.

Here's the updated code:
```python
def get_coin_sums(cents):
    coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]
    counts = [0, 0, 0, 0]
    for i in range(len(coins)):
        if cents >= coins[i]:
            counts[i] += 1
    return counts
```
