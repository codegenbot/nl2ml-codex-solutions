const array<const char*, 13> roman = {"m", "cm", "d", "cd", "c", "xc", "l", "xl", "x", "ix", "v", "iv", "i"};

The error message is indicating that there are multiple definitions of `main()` and that one of them has an extra `` character at the end of line 19. To fix this, you can try removing the extra `` character and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, it's possible that there is another definition of `main()` in the code that needs to be removed or merged with the existing definition.
