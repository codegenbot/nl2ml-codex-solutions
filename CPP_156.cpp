The issue is that the `std::vector` constructor used in the code is trying to allocate memory for the elements of the vector, but the allocator class used by the vector does not have an `operator new` function that takes two arguments (the second argument is a pointer to the address where the memory should be allocated).

To fix this issue, you can use the `std::vector` constructor that takes a single argument, which is a list of elements to initialize the vector with. For example:
```cpp
std::vector<std::string> roman = {"m", "cm", "d", "cd", "c", "xc", "l", "xl", "x", "ix", "v", "iv", "i"};
```
Alternatively, you can use the `std::vector` constructor that takes a single argument and an allocator class, but make sure to pass in a valid allocator class. For example:
```cpp
std::vector<std::string> roman(13, std::allocator<std::string>());
roman[0] = "m";
roman[1] = "cm";
// ...
```
This will initialize the vector with 13 elements and set their values to "m", "cm", etc..
