def leaders(arr):
    result = []
    current_leader = arr[-1]
    for i in range(len(arr)-2, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] >= current_leader:
            result.append(current_leader)
            current_leader = arr[i]
    return result
```

This code uses a similar approach as the previous solution, but it is more concise and efficient. It uses a single loop to iterate through the input array in reverse order, and it keeps track of the current leader element. If the current element is greater than or equal to the current leader, then it adds the current leader to the result list. Otherwise, it updates the current leader with the current element.

The code also uses a few Pythonic idioms, such as using negative indices to iterate through the input array in reverse order, and using the `append` method to add elements to the result list. Overall, this solution is more concise and efficient than the previous one, while still being easy to understand and modify.
