This is a contest problem from the C++ category on HackerRank. The task description is as follows:

"Given an integer n, find the number of pairs of integers (a, b) such that a < b and a^2 + b^2 = n."

Here's one possible solution in C++:
```
#include <iostream>

int countPairs(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if ((i * i + j * j) == n) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
This solution uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs of integers (a, b) such that a < b. Inside the inner loop, we check whether (i * i + j * j) is equal to n. If it is, we increment the count variable by 1. Finally, we return the total number of pairs found.

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which may be slow for large values of n. A more efficient solution using a different approach, such as the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity or the binary search method, can be implemented to achieve a better time complexity.
