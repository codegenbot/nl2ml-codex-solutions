Note that the `issame` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the two sets are equal or not. The `all` function is used to check if all elements in one set are present in the other set, and vice versa.
```
Modify the code as  The errors are indicating that there is an issue with the function signature of `issame`. The error message is suggesting that it expects a primary expression before the type `int`, and that the expression list is being treated as a compound expression in initializer. Additionally, the function `issame` was not declared in the scope of the `main()` function.

To fix these errors, you should change the function signature to match the expected format. Instead of using two vectors as input parameters, you can use a single vector and pass it by reference to the function. This will allow you to use the `std::all_of` algorithm to check if all elements in one set are present in the other set.

Here's an example of how you could modify your code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

bool issame(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
    return std::all_of(a.begin(), a.end(), [&b](int x){ return std::find(b.begin(), b.end(), x) != b.end(); });
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Enter the first set of numbers: ";
    std::vector<int> a;
    int temp;
    while (std::cin >> temp) {
        a.push_back(temp);
    }

    std::cout << "Enter the second set of numbers: ";
    std::vector<int> b;
    while (std::cin >> temp) {
        b.push_back(temp);
    }

    if (issame(a, b)) {
        std::cout << "The two sets are the same." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The two sets are not the same." << std::endl;
    }
}
```.
