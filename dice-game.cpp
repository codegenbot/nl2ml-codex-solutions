```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n = 1;
    int m = 2;
    std::cout << "Probability that Peter rolls strictly higher than Colin: ";
    std::cout << probability(n, m) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This code will call the `probability` function with the arguments `n` and `m`, which are defined in the code. The `std::cout` statements will print the result of the `probability` function to the console.
