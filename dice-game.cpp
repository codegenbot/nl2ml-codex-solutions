#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n = 0; // number of sides on Peter's die
    int m = 0; // number of sides on Colin's die
    double probability = getProbability(n, m);
    std::cout << "The probability that Peter rolls strictly higher than Colin is: " << probability << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This code defines a `main` function that takes no arguments and returns an integer. Inside the `main` function, it calls the `getProbability` function with the values of `n` and `m`, and then prints the result to the console using `std::cout`. Finally, it returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

With this change, your code should compile and run without any issues.
