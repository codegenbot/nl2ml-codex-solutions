```
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::array<float, 3> v = {1, 2, 3};
    std::cout << "Maximum element: " << max_element(v) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code is that there are multiple definitions of `main()` function in the code. To fix this error, you can rename one of the `main()` functions to something else, or you can remove one of the definitions altogether. Additionally, you need to include the header file for the `max_element` function, which is included in the `<algorithm>` library.

Here's the modified code that should work:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::array<float, 3> v = {1, 2, 3};
    std::cout << "Maximum element: " << max_element(v) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
