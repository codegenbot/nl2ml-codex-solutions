```
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <cassert>

int main() {
    std::array<int, 3> v = {1, 2, 3};
    assert(abs(std::max_element(v.begin(), v.end()) - 124) < 1e-4);
    return 0;
}
```

The code above is a valid C++ program that defines a `main()` function and uses the `assert` macro to check if the maximum element in an array of three integers is within a certain tolerance of 124. The `std::max_element` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header is used to find the maximum element in the array, and the `abs` function from the `<cmath>` header is used to calculate the absolute difference between the maximum element and 124.

The error message you mentioned indicates that there are two definitions of `main()` in the code, which is not allowed in C++. To fix this issue, you can remove one of the `main()` functions and make sure that only one function with that name exists in your program.
