```
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::array<float, 3> v = {1, 2, 3};
    assert (abs(std::max_element(v.begin(), v.end()) - 124) < 1e-4);
    return 0;
}
```
The issue is caused by redefining the `main` function twice in the same scope. To fix this, you can remove one of the two `int main()` functions and merge its contents with the other function.

Additionally, the error message suggests that you may have forgotten to include the `std::` namespace prefix for the `max_element` function. Make sure to add this prefix to the function call in order to avoid any ambiguity.
