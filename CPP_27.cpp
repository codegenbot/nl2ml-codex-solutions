```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cassert>

std::string flip_case(const std::string& str) {
    // Implement the function here
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "These violent delights have violent ends";
    std::string expected_output = "tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS";
    assert(flip_case(input) == expected_output);
}
```

The issue is caused by the fact that `size()` function has been removed from the standard library as of C++14, and the compiler is using a version prior to C++14.

To fix this error, you can replace `size()` with `__lhs.size()`. This will use the same logic but in a way that is compatible with older versions of the standard library.

Alternatively, if you are using a modern compiler that supports C++14 or later, you can update your code to use the `std::string` class from the C++14 standard library, which has a `size()` function.
