std::string flip_case(const std::string& str) {
    // Implement the function here
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "These violent delights have violent ends";
    std::string expected_output = "tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS";
    assert(flip_case(input).length() == expected_output.length());
}
```

The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the `insert` function being called on a constant iterator, which is not allowed. The function signature for `insert` requires a non-constant iterator as its first argument, but the code is passing in a constant iterator instead. To fix this, you can change the type of the `input` variable to be a non-const reference, like this:
```
std::string& input = "These violent delights have violent ends";
```
This will allow the `insert` function to modify the string and avoid the error.
