    """This function calculates the maximum amount of water that can be held in a grid based on its dimensions and a given capacity. The input grid is a list of lists where '0' represents an empty cell, '1' represents a column with no water, and '2' represents a column with some water. The function iterates over each row in the grid, calculates how much water can be added to the current remaining capacity, and updates the total water amount and remaining capacity accordingly.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the dimensions of the grid.
        capacity (int): An integer representing the maximum capacity of the grid.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum amount of water that can be held in the grid.
