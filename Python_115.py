```
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    water = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                water += 1
    return math.ceil(water / capacity)
```
Modified code:
```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    water = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                water += 1
    return math.ceil(water / capacity)
```
The issue with the code was that it was using the `math` module without importing it first. To fix this, I added the following line at the beginning of the file:
```python
import math
```
This imports the `math` module and allows you to use its functions, including `ceil`.
