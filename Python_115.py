Solve the following code contest problem: Python/115.

Problem Description: Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum number of units that can be filled in the array subject to the condition that no two units are adjacent. For example, if the input array is [2, 1, 3], then the output should be 4 because we can fill 2 units at position 0, 1 unit at position 1, and 1 unit at position 2, which gives a total of 4 units.

Input: A list of integers.

Output: An integer representing the maximum number of units that can be filled in the array.
