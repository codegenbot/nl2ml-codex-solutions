"""
This problem gives a string of parentheses. The program must return true if the string is valid and false if it is not valid. A valid string is defined as a string that contains only parentheses and is balanced. A balanced string is defined as a string where each open parentheses is closed by a corresponding closed parentheses. For example, (()()()) is a valid and balanced string while (()() is not valid.
